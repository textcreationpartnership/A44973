            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Readers.</head>
            <p>THe Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> having ſmitten us on the face, both on the right cheek and on the left; leſt our deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence be brought in evidence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim our guiltineſs, and ſo having loſt our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, we ſhould loſe our good Names alſo, which ought to be dearer to us than our very Lives, It may ſeem high time to Apologize for our ſelves, and to make it appear to the World, that we are not ſo black and ugly as we are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor ſo bad as we are repreſented. Our Apology ſhall be that of the bleſſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> a little alter'd, (againſt whom alſo they brought many and grievous Accuſations, which they were not able to prove) <hi>They have not found us in the Temples</hi> (or Churches) <hi>diſputing with any man: neither raiſing up the people, neither in the Synagogues,</hi> (or places of Convention for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſes) <hi>or in the City; neither can they prove the things whereof they accuſe us.</hi> But this many of us confeſs, <hi>That After the way that they call Schiſm and Phanaticiſm, ſo worſhip me the God of our Fathers; believing all things that are written in the Old and New Teſtament, and in the Articles
<pb facs="tcp:56448:3"/>of Religion of the Church of England, ſo far as concerns the Doctrine of Faith and Sacraments.</hi> And are ſtill ready to ſubſcribe to all that the Learned and Famous Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaith was meant by Subſcription; namely, <hi>That we are perſwaded that the conſtant Doctrine of the Church of England is ſo pure and Orthodox, that whoſoever believes it, and lives according to it, ſhall be ſaved; and that there is no Error in it, which may neceſſitate any man to diſturb the peace, or renounce the communion of it.</hi> Now this being our Judgment, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we are acquitted from Schiſm in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and ought to be ſo in the Judgement of that learned and judicious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Saunderſon,</hi> who (as I have been credibly informed) being asked what he thought of the Subſcription before mentioned, ſaid, (after he had read it and conſidered it) <hi>I never ſubſcribed in any other ſenſe my ſelf.</hi> And that this Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might ſuffice in Equity and Conſcience (if the Supreme Authority ſhould think fit) my Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> hath declared in his Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, tendred unto King <hi>James:</hi> His words are theſe, — <hi>For Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, it ſeemeth to be in the nature of a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and therefore more proper to bind in the Unity of Faith; and to be urged rather for Articles of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than for Rites and Ceremonies, and points of outward Government: for howſoever politick Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations and Reaſons of State, may require Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb facs="tcp:56448:3"/>yet Chriſtian and Divine Grounds look chiefly upon Unity.</hi> It is the Duty of all Chriſtians to be zealous, and to contend earneſtly for the Unity of Faith, and to labour with all their might with themſelves and one another, for unity of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Luther</hi>'s Motto becomes every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>In quo aliquid Chriſti video illum diligo.</hi> That the moſt conſiderable <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are Sons of Peace, and not Sons of the Coal, may hence be argued, That thoſe who were Joynt-Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Reformation of the Liturgy, became humble and earneſt Petitioners to their Fellow-Commiſſioners the Biſhops, and others their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, for peace. That we are not generally ſuch <hi>Boutefeu</hi>'s and Incendiaries as we are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be, may in part appear in this, That we pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed no Anſwer for ſo long a time to two ſuch angry and provoking Pieces as theſe: And that little which is here done by way of Reflection, is with ſo great moderation: Doubtleſs if we had been utterly unable to have anſwered the <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Logick</hi> of theſe two Books, we could not have eaſily failed of abundantly requiting the Author of them with Stories and Recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Were all the Irregularities and Impieties of Men of our own Coat, though Canonical, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned up, and ſhould we give our ſelves leave to look back thirty or forty years for matter of Accuſation, (as the Author of the <hi>Friendly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56448:4"/>ſometimes doth) we might fill whole. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes with <hi>Errata's,</hi> and might occaſion the common Enemy of out Religion, to triumph over, and the common People to trample upon the <hi>Engliſh Miniſtry.</hi> Had the Author we deal withal, had like Charity with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, or with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed memory; he would rather have buried in ſilence the faults of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> than to have expoſed them, whether real or imaginary, to the Eye of the World, to be beheld through a Multiplying and a Magnifying-glaſs, as he doth. Yea, had he not come ſhort of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> the Centuriſt, in his Charity, he might have learnt of him not to have publiſhed a <hi>Second Part</hi> to blaze abroad the faults of his Brethren; there being now no <hi>War</hi> to inflame him, no <hi>Adverſary</hi> by any <hi>Reply</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him: The <hi>Non-conformists</hi> now outed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down on the ground, down in the mire, (and yet perhaps neither ſo dirty, or ſo much ſullyed, as were ſome formerly Sequeſtred, there being neither Scandal, nor Inſufficiency, ſo much as charged upon one of a thouſand, as any Reaſon or Cauſe of their Ejectment.) Had be uſed the like Candour towards the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> that Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi> doth towards the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and which I believe he expects from us towards his own Party; he would never have charged the faults and errors of a <hi>part</hi> upon the <hi>whole,</hi> of a <hi>few</hi> upon <hi>all,</hi> a very few excepted; and ſo doing,
<pb facs="tcp:56448:4"/>he might have ſpared wholly his Continuation, and have much abridged his firſt Dialogue. He needed not to have made ſo many blazes as he doth, by ſo often firing men of ſtraw of his own making; nor ſo great a noiſe in the world, by diſcharging ſo many great Guns, againſt Caſtles in the Air of his own building.</p>
            <p>But ſince he advanceth Reaſon ſo much in word, upon all occaſion, we may wonder he hath made no more real uſe of it in his Diſcourſe. For ſay we might (and think we can juſtifie it) that his Words are more than his Matter, his Rhetorick far beyond his Logick; and therefore we chooſe rather that he ſhould ſmite us with his Fiſt, than with the Palms of his Hands; I mean with his Logick, rather than with his Rhetorick. What Reaſon or Logick is in ſuch a Diſcourſe as this? Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>W. B.</hi> have Printed ſuch and ſuch things, therefore all, or almoſt all the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> are ſo and ſo; or Preach and Print thus and thus; or elſe Mr. <hi>Lewes Hughes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Viccars,</hi> the two Mr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> ſay or write thus; Ergo, this is the Way, the Spirit, and the Language of the whole Party. Or one or two in a Kingdom, or in the three Kingdoms, and that too, when the Kingdoms were all in a flame with the Civil War, were hot and fiery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ergo (now notwithſtanding that there has been nine years peace, an Act of Indempnity and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion paſſed, the generality of men formerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb facs="tcp:56448:5"/>quiet and quietly diſpoſed, uniting, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and ſoddering together, co-operating For the peace, ſettlement, and welfare of the whole (a few Clergy-men excepted) all that were ſometimes of the one Side or Party, muſt be looked upon as Hotſpurs, Incendiaries, very dangerous Perſons, Enemies to Authority ſtill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt have the skins of wild Beaſts put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and a hideous noiſe and out-cry made after them, on purpoſe to ſtir up the People to hunt them down, or worry them; or elſe to move and provoke Authority to make and ſpread Nets and Toyles to take them: Would it not have been more rational and Chriſtian, more Logical and Theological, for the Author to have argued thus; Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tuckney,</hi> Dr. <hi>Conant,</hi> and many others now living, though <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> are good men, good Chriſtians, good Subjects, good Preachers, good Writers; therefore we muſt not judge all our Brethren Inconformiſts, for the failings or miſcarriages of a few? Or might not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Debate,</hi> if he had pleaſed; have argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much better and ſtronger, thus; Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> and many others of the old <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> were meek and moderate, ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, zealous againſt Separation; therefore it hath not been the way and Spirit of <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> to be turbulent, movers of Sedition in the
<pb facs="tcp:56448:5"/>State, or makers of Rent and Schiſms in the Church? Or thus: Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> laid down their Lives for their Loyalty, and Mr. <hi>Cawton</hi> was indicted of High-Treaſon for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Majeſty that now is: The <hi>London</hi> and Country Miniſters declared zealouſly againſt all proceedings againſt the Crown and Life of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of Bleſſed Memory: Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spurſtow,</hi> Mr.<hi>Young,</hi> loſt their Maſterſhips at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and others their places elſewhere, for refuſing the Engagement. The <hi>Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Miniſters publiſhed a Book in Print a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Engagement, ſided with Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> in his Undertaking for his Majeſty. The Presbyterians generally throughout the Kingdom were cordial and zealous for his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Juſt and Royal Title: Therefore they are good men, and good Subjects to his Majeſty. Or if you will, thus: The Presbyterians and other <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> have really loſt their Livings, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep their Conſciences, have been and ſtill are generally either actively or paſſively obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Laws; pray for, and ſeek the peace and happineſs of the King and his Kingdoms; have in patience poſſeſſed their Souls above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years together, and all this while have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, even in their private <hi>Meetings,</hi> all exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and provoking Language, or publickly in print, ſcurrilous Pamphlets or Libels againſt the Government. And have not (as the Author of
<pb facs="tcp:56448:6"/>the <hi>Debate</hi> hath) endeavour'd to prejudice a great part of his <hi>Majeſties Subjects,</hi> by many Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Terms of diſtinction, contrary to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Royal Declaration, ordaining, <hi>That all Notes of Diſcord, Separation, and difference of Parties, be utterly aboliſhed among his Subjects:</hi> Therefore Presbyterians and other <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> are men of Peace, Religion and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch then as the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> hath endeavoured with his Sparks of Wit and Fire, to inflame light-headed and hot-headed Perſons, (if it be poſſible) to make a combuſtion, contrary to the Law of the Land, the Peace of our Soveraign Lord the King, and the great Law of Love and Peace, the Act of Oblivion; I would adviſe him to do Juſtice upon himſelf, in executing his own Books in the Flames, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incendiaries. The worſt I wiſh him is his Reformation; that for the time to come, he may be more charitable and good-natur'd; or more Sanguine than now he is, and leſs Sanguinary than theſe his Books ſpeak him to be.</p>
            <p>Next to our deſires to cure our Adverſary, I hope we may have leave to go about to heal our ſelves; and this I ſhall endeavour to do, by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out the Weapons that have made the wound, and by imitating the practiſe of the Sympatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors, namely, by applying ſome Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Balſam, or Healing-Plaiſters, to his two
<pb facs="tcp:56448:6"/>Weapons, his Sword and Dagger, or his Sword and Rapier, (call his two Books which you pleaſe) if by any means I may heal the wounds Which they have made.</p>
            <p>And though perhaps ſome others would never have ſcrupled to have anſwered theſe Pieces, Railery with Railery, or even Railing with Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to have thrown that Dirt in his Face which he put into our hands; and to have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to quench his Wild-fire, though with dirty and ſtinking <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Kennel-Water: Yet this hath not been my deſign, but rather the contrary, to overcome him with good uſage and good words; and becauſe I cannot give him as good Language as he brings, therefore to ſtudy to give him better; however nothing ſo bad; to uſe hard Reaſons, and ſoft Words; and herein to follow the Reverend and Judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> rather than <hi>Martin Mar-Prelate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the way and method I take in aſſaulting his two ſtrong Holds or Forts, (which ſome think impregnable) namely, why I do not charge in a right Line, and ruſh directly upon the Pikes, the <hi>Noli me Tangere</hi>'s of the Books; my anſwer is that of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon occaſion, <hi>I know very well what is fit for me to do, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my Ends, and am not come ſo far, to take counſel of my Enemy.</hi> Or as another Prince ſaid, <hi>I will not take a burning Coal out of the fire with my bare Fingers, when I can do it better with a pair of
<pb facs="tcp:56448:7"/>Tongs.</hi> I add further, It doth not neceſſarily argue the want of a good Cauſe, or a good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to come on the Flank or Reer of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as well as on the Front; or to ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to give Ground and Wheel-about, with a deſign to charge with the more advantage.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not detain you much longer, Good Reader, in the Porch, being ſenſible of being ſo long already: May I crave your leave to make a brief Declaration, a ſhort Petition, and to enter a reaſonable Proteſtation.</p>
            <p>I Declare, I do hold <hi>the Elders that</hi> Preach Well, or <hi>Rule well,</hi> or Live well, by what names or titles ſoever dignified or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether they be Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors or Curates; whether they be Conformiſts or Nonconformiſts, to <hi>be worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> And that I had much rather we could meet each other half-way, to reconcile our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and to give each other the right hand of Fellowship, than to try it out for Victory by theſe Pen and Paper Combates any longer; leſt Atheiſm and Popery be advantaged by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, and enter in at our breaches. I would not have Miniſtes of either perſwaſion, be like the ſilly Coneys that continually fight and tear one another, without ever joyning to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt the Polcat. I declare alſo, I do not, in, or by this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> condemn <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> or commend <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> as ſuch; yet
<pb facs="tcp:56448:7"/>I cannot but own my utter diſlike of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practiſes of ſome high <hi>Conformiſts</hi> or <hi>Hectors</hi> for Conformity; namely, ſuch as prefer the Romiſh Church, before the Reformed Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine Churches; <hi>Arminius</hi> before St. <hi>Auſtine;</hi> who judge <hi>Aerius</hi> a greater Heretick than <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> who have more charity for thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Deity of our Saviour, than for thoſe that ſcruple the ſtrict <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy; and who can with more Patience hear a Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Being of a Deity, than about the taking away of a Ceremony; that profeſs themſelves the chiefeſt Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet diſſent from her Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Articles, Homilies, and Liturgie; and tranſgreſs the Laws of the Church about Rites and Ceremonies, by going too far on the right hand, or running too far before them, and become <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> themſelves, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Act of Uniformity, even by their extream Conformity. Theſe, theſe are the <hi>Hectors,</hi> I mean, who when they have perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man to ſtrain hard to go a mile with them in Conformity, will compel him to go twaine; that are implacable Enemies to <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> though peaceable and Pious; and are no good Friends to <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> except under the ſame degree of Longitude and Latitude with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Yea, I may ſay, that notwithſtanding their pretended zeal ard devotion to the Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy,
<pb facs="tcp:56448:8"/>look on former Archbiſhops, ſuch as <hi>Grindal, Whitgift, Abbot,</hi> as Puritans, and would (if they could) Unbiſhop ſome of the preſent Biſhops for <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As tor the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> I hope better things of him; and though he be a Champion for the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> cauſe, and I differ from him in many things; yet I muſt confeſs I do not look on him as one of the <hi>Hectors</hi> before deſcribed; but I ſay of him rather, <hi>Talis quùn ſit utinam noſter eſſet;</hi> For I am confident, that one of his parts, learning and ſtile, could eaſily make a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> wherein the high <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> ſhould appear as ſimple and ridiculous as he hath made the <hi>Non-conformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Petition, my humble and hearty Petition is to the <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> the moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend the Archbiſhops, and the Right reverend the Biſhops, and to the <hi>Sons of the Church,</hi> our Conforming Brethren, That they would mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their love to Peace, by their condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſires of Union, with their diſſenting Brethren; and that there might be, by the means of the <hi>Governours of our Church,</hi> their Mediation with His Majeſty and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome ſuch Laws made, as might for ever take away the differences 'twixt them and thoſe that are for <hi>Moderation,</hi> that ſtill hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though not admitted to be Teachers in it: And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:56448:8"/>Oh! that it were in their hearts, as many of them as hold Communion with the Reformed Churches beyond Seas, to offer ſuch Bill or Bills to King and Parliament, as might enable the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to receive all again into the Boſom of the Church, and to the Exerciſe of their <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> who beſides taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> can conform to what is neceſſary in other Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>And my earneſt deſire to all <hi>Nonconformists is,</hi> That they love and follow the Truth and Peace; that they endeavour after Union and Coalition; however that they avoid Schiſm and Separation, truly ſo called: And eſpecially that they keep far from that dividing Principle, <hi>To imagine a thing of it ſelf indifferent, to be therefore unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe commanded by a lawful Authority;</hi> and alſo from that grand Crime of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that unchurched all beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My</hi> Proteſtation is this, That whereas the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> hath offered us <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> many and great Affronts, hath made ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hard and deſperate Thruſts or Paſſes at us, and hard thereby forced us at laſt to Draw in our own Defence; That if he ſhall preſently cauſe our Perſons or Weapons to be arreſted or ſeized therefore, He may never more be proclaimed for a Couragious Champion, nor the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> poſted for baſe Cowards.</p>
            <p>If the High Sons of the Church have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb facs="tcp:56448:9"/>and Priviledge to throw Ink in out Faces; the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Sons of Peace, and his Majeſties good Subjects, may have we hope a Toleration or Connivence to wipe it off.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed; Since the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> hath ſo vehemently charged us, and put in a Firſt and a Second Indictment againſt us, for Irreligion, Diſloyalty, Schiſm, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We plead, NOT GUILTY; And put our ſelves upon the Tryal of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which be You.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bramhal,</hi> that learned Prelate, may be their Advocate in this Caſe; (I hope the Sons of the Church will not diſdain to hearken to a Father of the Church) <hi>Thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed minds, free from diſtracting cares, and Means to maintain them, and Friends to aſſiſt them, and their Books and Notes about them; do little imagine with what difficulty poor Exiles ſtruggle, whoſe minds are more intent on what they ſhould eat to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, than what they ſhould write.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bramhal</hi> of Schiſm, pag. 275. Beſides, if an Anſwer had ſtolen forth without Licenſe, would it not have been arreſted for a ſeeming breach of a late Act about Printing; and the Author of it, according to the Divinity and Logick of the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56448:12"/>pag. 3. concluded to be neither a good Subject, nor a good Chriſtian? (<hi>vide Deb. pag.</hi> 2. <hi>Edit.</hi> 4.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whit Anſwer then can be made for printing this preſent Anſwer and Apology?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Intent and Deſign of Laws, is the Conſervation of the Publick Peace. The Law is Juſt, Uniform, and no Reſpecter of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether Conformiſts, or Non-Conformiſts, but binds all to the Peace and Good Behaviour alike, doth not hold one Mans Hands, whilſt Another cuts his Throat, or ſtabs him under the fifth Rib. If a Man be once and again violently aſſaulted, he may lawfully defend himſelf. The Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> hath ſmitten us on the one Cheek, and on the other alſo; hath reviled us, and with his Pen perſecuted us, and ſaid all manner of evil againſt us falſly. In this caſe, a dead and ſtupid ſilence, might argue we were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily guilty concerning the Crimes laid againſt us. If a man that is Charged, Indicted, and Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, refuſeth to plead, the Law adjudgeth him to be preſſed to death. Our bleſſed Saviour himſelf Apologized for himſelf and his Diſciples. So did <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> for the Primitive Chriſtians. The great and ſoul Blots which have been caſt upon our Names by that Author, would not ſoon out, if no means or endeavors ſhould be uſed to wipe them off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But is every Tranſgreſſion of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law, though but penal, ſo culpable of criminous as is pretended?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56448:12"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I humbly conceive not. And there are thouſands of good Subjects, and good Chriſtians (many of them good Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) who did eat Fleſh laſt Lent, or laſt <hi>Fryday,</hi> asking no Queſtion for Conſcience-ſake, in reference to any penal Law or Statute in that Caſe; and who have not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to bury their Dead in Linen, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a late Act of Parliament. And if you lay ſo great a Burthen upon every breach of a penal Statute, how ſhall the Carrier long keep his Cart on Wheels, or the Citizen long ſtand on his Legs for want of Trading, by reaſon of an Act of Parliament requiring the Tire of the Wheels to be four Inches wide, under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of forty Shillings for each offence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is it not therefore enough to ſatisfie the Law to pay the Mulct or Penalty required in ſuch Caſes? (<hi>Vide Contin. pag.</hi> 22.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> famous both at Home and Abroad, for his great Piety and Learning, hath amongſt his Caſes of Conſcience, this Caſe: <hi>Whether Students in Colledges, and Members of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, are tied to obſervance of their Local Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, under pain of Perjury?</hi> In reſolving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he hath ſomething uſeful, and pertinent to our purpoſe: He ſaith, <hi>That Statutes are of two ſorts, Principal and Fundamental, or leſs principal; the first ſort, belonging to the Being of the Society, are neceſſary to be kept under pain of Perjury: As
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56448:13"/>to the leſt principal, namely, Statutes that are for Order and Decency, the Founder er Law-Maker exacts not Obedience ſimply, but either Obedience or the Penalty; becauſe the Penalty is as much benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the ſtate of the Body, as the other, that is, as actual Obedience:</hi> And in this Caſe, he doth not charge the Breach of any Local Statute with the crime of Perjury. And Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> in his <hi>Rule of holy Living,</hi> Chap. 3. pag. 183. ſaith thus: <hi>As long as the Law is obligatory, ſo long our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is due; and he that begins a contrary Cuſtom without reaſon, ſinneth: But he that breaks the Law when the Cuſtom is entred and fixed, is excuſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ſuppoſed the Legiſlative Power conſents, when by not puniſhing, it ſuffers Diſobedience to grow up to a Cuſtom.</hi> And I have formerly learnt it for good Divinity, That every meer or bare Omiſſion to do a thing required by Law, is not a ſin, <hi>(extra caſum ſcandali &amp; contemptus)</hi> provided it be not done ſcandalouſly and contemptuouſly, or with offence to our weak Brother, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What's all this to the Caſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Nonconformiſts?</hi> Do not they ſcandalouſly and contemptuouſly break the Laws, in dwelling in and neat <hi>London,</hi> and holding Religious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, commonly called Conventicles? (<hi>Vide Debate, page</hi> 2.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many of them have taken the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, and are legally qualified to live in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56448:13"/>Others cannot poſſibly live in the Countries, for want of a Livelihood. I have heard of a Reverend Miniſter, that going abroad to ſeek maintenance from well-diſpoſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, being benighted, loſt his Way and his Life both, being through cold ſtarved to death. Others perhaps will plead they cannot live peaceably in the Country: I heard one, and a principal one, ſay, He never looked towards the City, nor ever ſhould, if he had not been driven out of the Country. The Law of Nature teaches the Hart, the Hare, and all Creatures that are purſued, to fly to the neareſt and thickeſt Covert, or hiding place. I have heard Huntſmen talk of giving the Hare Law; I do not well underſtand Forreſt Law: but I believe this is not meant by it, That ſhe ſhall have no mercy if ſhe ſeeks to hide or to ſave her ſelf by flight from thoſe that purſue her. There are alſo ſome amongſt the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> that think themſelves bound to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and though they will not intrude into Churches, which are at the Magiſtrates diſpoſal, yet they look upon it as their Duty to preach in private Houſes: And for that in <hi>London</hi> and other Cities, the multitude of thoſe that deſire to hear, are greater than in other places, and their Meetings here may be leaſt taken notice of, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore probably they repair to theſe places of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And what Fowler had not rather ſhoot at a Flock, than at two or three ſingle Birds?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56448:14"/>And what Fiſherman would not chuſe father to caſt his Net into the main Sea, than into a ſmall Brook? The Quarrel of <hi>Fimbria</hi> againſt <hi>Scevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> was, That he would not receive the Weapon of Death far enough into his Body; and the ſame is the Quarrel that ſome of our Brethren have againſt us, That there being ſuch ſharp Laws made againſt us, we are not willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our naked Breſts to the point of them, and let our Brethren gage us with their Weapons, but chuſe rather to fly from Country to City, and from City to City, to hide our ſelves. Some there are, who can ſay they hold no Meetings contrary to Law. There are that hold ſome private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but firſt they and their Auditors go to Church, and hear Common-Prayer and Sermon there. Moſt of thoſe that do otherwiſe may be ſuppoſed to be in and about <hi>London,</hi> where, by reaſon of the burning of above fourſcore Pariſh Churches, the Churches that remain may not be capacious enough to receive or hold all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and beſides may poſſibly be at inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtances from their preſent Habitations. If you ſay, That the <hi>Old Nonconformists,</hi> when they were ſilenc'd by the Biſhops, forbore to preach, and juſtified their ſilence againſt the Browniſts who accuſed them for it. To this may be replied, That the number of Ejected Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters formerly, were not comparable to what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is now; uſually not one to one hundred, to wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56448:14"/>it is in our days. Beſides, the People that are diſſatisfied with the Liturgy or Ceremonies now, are ten, if not a hundred to one, to what they were formerly. What ſhall Miniſters do in this Caſe? Our Saviour when he ſaw the multitudes, had compaſſion on them, becauſe they were as Sheep Without a Shepherd. Had you rather that <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Seducers</hi> ſhould gather up Multitudes; and that Taverns, Alehouſes, and worſe places, ſhould on the Lords day be filled with the number of thoſe that abſent themſelves from the publick Aſſemblies, rather than that they ſhould be tolerated to hear a Sermon of Faith and Repentance, and other Duties towards God, and of Loyalty to the King, of Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one towards another, in a private houſe? For my own part, I confeſs in this Caſe, I would much rather go learn what that means, <hi>The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt truly is great, and the Labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt.</hi> Again, it is to be conſidered, that Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> and others, were ſilenced formerly but in ſome Dioceſſes, and for ſome time; afterwards they got diverſe times liberty to preach. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> had a Licenſe to preach, under the Broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> procured by Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> then Lord Keeper, notwithſtanding his inconformity. Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> notwithſtanding he had writ ſo much, and ſo ſharply againſt Conformity, was ſuffered
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56448:15"/>to preach, and enjoyed a place of Maſter of an Hoſpital at <hi>Warwick</hi> to his dying day. Yea, Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> if we believe the Hiſtorian, was ſuffered to keep a Living, and that no mean one, (<hi>Achurch</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>) to his Death. The Biſhops in thoſe dayes, if they turned Men out of their Pulpits, let them have a Livelihood; either ſome way from their Livings, or elſe permitted them, or connived at leaſt, at their teaching of School. My School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter at a Grammar-School, was one that had left a Living, rather man he would Conform. And 'tis ſtoried of old Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Heplin,</hi> that though he refuſed to ſubſcribe to any thing but the Greek Teſtament, yet he enjoyed his Prebends place in <hi>Salisbury</hi> till his dying day.</p>
            <p>'Tis worthy our notice, that theſe mens Yoak was more eaſie than ours: And that notwithſtanding they are thought to be of different Principles from the preſent <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> yet certain it is, that they held it lawful to preach and pray, and keep days of Humiliation in private Houſes. And I was told by one Mr. <hi>W.</hi> That <hi>he never had any other Ordination but Prayers and Impoſition of hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Upon the conſideration of the Premiſes, my hearts deſire is, That the preſent Age may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>ſurpaſs</hi> the Age paſt; the Right Reverend the Biſhops, their Predeceſſors,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56448:15"/>in their Forbearance and Moderation; and the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> theirs, in their Meekneſs and Peaceableneſs: That the Biſhops would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be Reconcilers, and Repairers of out Breaches, and Reſtorers of our Pulpits to preach in; and that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> would deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what may become Sons of Peace, and ſuch as earneſtly long after Unity, and had much rather, as becomes Labourers, be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to work in the Vineyard, than to ſtand any longer idle in the Market-place: Or, as becomes Fiſhers of Men, to be caſting their Nets on the right ſide of the Ship, than to ſit any longer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Nets on the Shore. That ſo the Ages to come, when they ſhall read the Hiſtory of this Generation, when we all (<hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi>) are laid down to reſt quietly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Graves, may have no occaſion to riſe up and ſay, <hi>That whereas the late War had made its thouſands of Separatiſts, Rigid Conformity had made its ten thouſands;</hi> And all this too, during the peaceable Reign of our moſt Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, (a Son of Peace) <hi>CHARLES the Clement;</hi> as he hath manifeſted himſelf, by his Royal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> his Royal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations ſince, and his preſent Princely Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: And this too, notwithſtanding great Animoſities, Exaſperations, and Irritations of ſome, on the one hand, out of an inordinate Zeal; and many Weakneſſes, Follies, and Provocations

            <p>Anſw. <hi>'Tis a ſign of exaſperation</hi> (ſaith my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> upon the like difference) <hi>to condemn the contrary part as a Sect; yea, and ſome indiſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been bold in open preaching, to uſe diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and derogative ſpeech and cenſure of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches abroad; and that ſo far, at that ſome of our Men (as I have heard) ordained in forraign Parts, have been pronounced to be no lawful Miniſters</hi> So he. <hi>And further, Let's remember</hi> (ſaith the ſame judicious Author) <hi>that the ancient and true Bonds of Unity, are, One Faith, one Baptiſm; and not, One Ceremony, one Policy: And endeavour to comprehend that ſaying,</hi> Differentia Rituum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendat unitatem Doctrinae; <hi>Chriſts Coat was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without Seam, yet the Churches Garment was of divers Colours.</hi> The Presbyterian and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> do profeſs to agree in the main Doctrine with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in her Articles of Religion, ſo as fully to embrace, and conſtantly to adhere unto what is purely Doctrinal in them.

And the reaſon why ſome (whilſt they continue in the City) do not frequent the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, may be this; Becauſe they are here by connivance onely, and dare not be ſeen openly to out-face a Law: But when they are in the Countrey, they joyn with the Congregation where they reſide <hi>protempore,</hi> to ſhew their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church, and Conformity to the Laws.

Some of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and other men in great place, have felt the burden of ſome things required of them; Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> would willingly have been diſpenced withal, as to ſome of the Epiſcopal Habits.

The eighth, That they may not be troubled for the omiſſion of ſome Rites or Portions preſcribed in the Book of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56448:22"/>Common-Prayer. The ninth, That they may not be called and urged to anſwer before the Officials and Commiſſaries, but before the Biſhops themſelves.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way were then, and ſtill are for Liberty of Conſcience; and the Presbyterians humbly move for the like Favour and Liberty which others had in thoſe days, different as to Government from them in the like Circumſtances. They forbore the impoſing of unneceſſary things, or ſuch things
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56448:22"/>as were doubtful, in and about the ſervice of God, as terms and conditions of Communion with them. Beſides, they ſuffered many of the Epiſcopal perſwaſion without ever taking the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to enjoy places in Churches, Colledges, and Schools. And 'tis notoriouſly known, That Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> afterward Biſhop <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> and others, had numerous Meetings for Common Prayer and Preaching, at <hi>London;</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hyde,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> and others, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in thoſe days. As to the five poor men (as the Author calls the Apologiſts) they had liberty to preach, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the fatteſt and richeſt publick Lectures in <hi>London.</hi> Give me leave to add too, that the Parliament by their Ordinance allowed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops 200 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for their Lives; and I find in the Life of Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> that he had an Order to have 1000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Treaſury at <hi>Goldſmiths-Hall,</hi> with which he paid his Debts, and purchaſed to himſelf an Annuity of 200 <hi>l. per annum</hi> during his Life. And a fifth part of Livings, where the Miniſter was ejected, for maintenance of Wife and Children: And ſcarce any man in thoſe days, that was able, ſober, and peaceable, but might, if he had pleaſed, have Employment and a Livelyhood. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made no Act for Baniſhment of them from Corporations, forbad them not to teach Schools, or entertain Boarders in their Houſes, impoſed no Oath on Women that taught School, to capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56448:23"/>them for that Calling, or elſe left them lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lbe to puniſhment for ſo doing. And although they made two Ordinances againſt the uſe of the Common Prayer, I never knew one that ſuffered the penalty of them.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Were there no Ceremonies impoſed by the Presbyterians in any part of the Worſhip of God?

And is not an Oath a ſpecial part of Divine Worſhip? (<hi>See Debate, p.</hi> 166. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.)</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> An Oath being an immediate and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Appeal to God, and having ſomething of Invocation, of the Divine Majeſty in it, doth therefore require ſome Geſture or Poſtute, that is naturally expreſſive of Reverence, at the taking of it.

And as for their practiſe, I ſay, greater Loyalty than this hath no man, than that a man lay down his life for his Soveraign; and yet ſuch were ſome of them; (as Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibbons.</hi>)

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some think it impoſſible for a man, without ſpecial warrant from God, to ſanctifie ſo that the ſervice performed unto God upon that day ſhould be more acceptable than on any other. Some think the abuſes of thoſe Feſtival dayes are ſo great, common and cuſtomary, that if his Majeſty and the Parliament ſaw good, it would be better and more eaſie, to aboliſh the Obſervation of them, than to take away the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, which they think cleaves to them like the Leproſie in the wall of the houſe. That theſe Feaſts were of Apoſtolical inſtitution, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Apoſtles, any except <hi>Eaſter,</hi> is not ſo much as pretended unto that I read of; <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> hath told us the Original of them, to be of a much later date: And as for the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> it ſelf, Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> is of opinion that it was an Error to hold it neceſſary to obſerve ſuch a Feaſt; and the Controverſie about the Time (which ſet all the World in a Combuſtion; and were it not that both ſides pretended Conſcience in the caſe,<note place="margin">Hales of Schiſm, p. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> he thinks them all guilty of Schiſm) he ſaith was a matter moſt unneceſſary and vaine, The old Nonconforming Miniſters did uſe to take the opportunity of thoſe dayes to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56448:33"/>preach in to the people. Some Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have no Saints dayes, but only keep ſome few dayes Holy in remembrance of our Saviour, or relating to the bleſſed Trinity: So as I take it, doth the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> even at this day. For my own part I think the Church of <hi>England</hi> is well juſtified by Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> from Superſtition in her obſervance of the Feſtival dayes ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. I can aſſure you there are that can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a day to give thanks for the victory of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> over the Devil, which neither did, nor could, nor would keep a day to give thanks for the victory of <hi>O. C.</hi> over the King at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> or of <hi>Lambert</hi> over Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> As for occaſional dayes of Faſting and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have not been ſo much ſcrupled in the World by ſober men, nor may be ſo liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or abuſe, as the ſtated Faſts and Feaſts may; and I think uſually they are mote ſtrictly obſerved. As for the Nonconformiſts private dayes, which the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> ſpeaks of, if they keep them no better (thoſe that do keep them) than many, if not moſt do, the ordinary ſtated Faſts and Feaſts, I think they may do every whit as well to lay them aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Next to Holy-dayes, what do the Nonconforming-Miniſters think of the Surplice, and the reſt, commonly called Holy Garments; Is it not a ſuperſtitious and a very ſuperfluous zeal which boyls over ſo againſt theſe things?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56448:34"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some I confeſs are offended the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice becauſe abuſed in the time, of Popery to ſuperſtition; and conceive poſſibly, that becauſe Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s In junctions or Articles ſay, that <hi>the gray Amice ſhall not be uſed, becauſe it hath been ſo abuſed to Superſtition;</hi> that there is the like equity for the diſuſe of the Surplice. There was a Learned, and Pious Perſon, once ſaid, <hi>He had often worn the Surplice, but he thought he ſhould rather be hang'd than wear it again.</hi> For my own part, I ſhould be loth to be a Martyr for or againſt the Surplice; being commanded to be uſed by the Church, not as having any holineſs in it, but onely as a decent Garment: Yea, I ſhould be loth to be kept out of the Church or Pulpit by Suilling. The truth is, the Surplice is little beholding to thoſe Doctors, that are the Champions for its uſe, when they tell us that it may teach us purity and holineſs, wherewith we are to be cloathed: And may it not as well mind us of the leproſie of ſin wherewith we come into the World Lepers as white as Snow? Or when they tell us that the Saints that follow the Lamb in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> were <hi>all cloathed with long White Robes;</hi> for by this reaſon all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, men and women, as well as the Miniſter, ſhould wear Surplices; and this too would make more for Uniformity.</p>
            <p>Whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>That there it at much to be ſaid for a Miniſters wearing a Surplice, at for his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56448:34"/>wearing a white Cap; and that there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for any to be offended to ſee a Miniſter wear a black Hood, or a Surplice, than to ſee him wear a white Cap under a black.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, That the Surplice is a Garment commanded to be worn by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Chapel or Church, and for the time of his Adminiſtration onely: The Cap is <hi>ad libitum,</hi> at his choice, and worn at all times, and places, and employments alike; and not appropriated to holy perſons or holy ſervices; and what more reaſon why any man ſhould be offended to ſee a white Cap under a black, than to ſee a little black Jack tipp'd with Silver? As for the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Lawn Sleeves,</hi> (whatever the Judge ſaid) I hope <hi>they ſhall not choak me.</hi> The <hi>Caſſock</hi> was a Garment for a Souldier, and may well enough become thoſe of the <hi>Spiritual Militia.</hi> The <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingle,</hi> as 'tis call'd, is not for us <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> being turn'd out to Graſs: Yet I would much rather chuſe to have it about my <hi>Middle,</hi> than my <hi>Neck;</hi> and to <hi>wear a Girdle,</hi> than to <hi>want</hi> a <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſeriouſly to addreſs my ſelf to the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate:</hi> I think an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent temper about indifferent things, is the beſt; my Religion ſtands not in crying them up or down; I cannot be very zealous for or againſt them: Yet methinks it doth not argue much skill or cunning in a Chapman that hath Wares to ſell,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56448:35"/>to tell his Cuſtomers, when they enquire and would be ſatisfied about the goodneſs of them, They are indifferent, they are indifferent. Theſe things of themſelves, and in themſelves conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with other humane Ceremonies, are but lawful, or indifferent, not neceſſary, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers and Sons of the Church. They are held, the Surplice and other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, utterly unlawful in the Judgments and Conſciences of many on whom they are impoſed. Now grant it be their weakneſs ſo ſtrongly and zealouſly to oppoſe theſe things; yet I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech the Moſt Reverend and Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers of the Church, ſeriouſly to weigh and conſider what that Great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Great Doctor of the Gentiles, would have done in that caſe.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> ſometime a prime <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> ſhall anſwer for them. <hi>They do not hold that they ought not to take bought before-hand what they ſhould pray, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Holy-Ghoſt ſhould immediately inſpire them with method, matter and words of Prayer; who ever ſaid, it was not they that prayed, but the Holy-Ghoſt praying in them. And yet in this duty as well as in others, the Sons of God are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is a Spirit of Grace and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and becauſe we know not what to ask, he helpeth our infirmities; and we may be ſaid to pray in the Spirit, not onely becauſe the holy Spirit doth ſtir up, warm and enlarge our affections in prayer, but be brings oft times to our remembrance the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory and ſuit able phraſes and paſſages of holy Writ, eſpecially the promiſes which are moſt pertinent to our purpoſe. Why ſhould any imagine that the evil ſpirit can have power to ſuggeſt evil thoughts or imaginations into us, to diſtract and hinder us when we are praying, and not the good and holy Spirit ſhould ſuggeſt good thoughts and deſires, and that too in his own language, I mean in Scripture-phraſe and expreſſions, bringing them at ſuch a time to our remembrance; Yea, the Holy-Ghost</hi> (ſaith that pious perſon) <hi>reſtrains the petulancy and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56448:39"/>of wit, great ſwelling words of vanity, vain bablings, idle repetitions, &amp;c. and he teaches us to pray in the words of truth and ſoberneſs. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a diſtinction betwixt the Gift of Prayer, and the Spirit of Prayer; The one is a common gift of the Spirit, the other is a ſpecial gift or grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that conſiſts in apt expreſſions, outward enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this in deep impreſſions on the heart, devout affections, which are too big for expreſſions; theſe are the ſighs and groans which cannot be uttered.</hi> A Reverend and worthy Prelate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> treating of the gift of Prayer, ſaith thus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for many of them they are not raſh to utter any thing before the Lord they are very ſerious and ſober in their expreſſions, affectionat and zealons in their utterance. There is a little
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56448:39"/>Book of the Prayers of many of the chief of them; taken, I ſuppoſe, in Short-hand, without their knowledge, and publiſhed (for ought I know) without their conſent; yet I conceive with ſome grains of allowance for common and pardonable errors, might paſs with an <hi>Imprimatur.</hi> And if there be ſome who have uſed unbecoming expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; Are there not to be found alſo among the Conformiſts guilty of the like Indecencies? Not to mention the Pr. of <hi>D. I. M.</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> nor the Pr. of D. R. at <hi>Windſor;</hi> I hope it may be pardonable to cite that of the D. which was printed with his own knowledge; <hi>Let the Gold of our Nobility excel in Grace as they do in Honour; purifie the Silver of our Gentry from the droſs of Vice; engrave upon the Braſs of the Communalty the fear of thy holy Name.</hi> As for their affectionate way of utterance, I ſuppoſe it may be a means to move themſelves &amp; others to ſutable affections to the duty they ate about. Vocal Prayer, where it can conveniently be uſed, is by ſome prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before mental, becauſe 'tis a means to excite affections, and prevent diſtraction. One end of Prayer, as a very learned Author tells us, is not to move or affect God, but our ſelves, that we may be fit to receive the good things that we beg of him; and then thoſe words and phraſes, and that way of utterance or ſpeaking which is moſt affectionate and leaſt affected, which is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the matter of the prayer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56448:40"/>alſo of good effects in our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought to be eſteemed leaſt liable to blame or exception. Is it not the part of an Oratour to change his voice and geſture, according to the variety of the ſubject or matter he is ſpeaking of? do not men begin an Oration with a low voice or tone ordinarily, and ſo riſe higher as they go further, and ordinarily are moſt intenſe and earneſt towards the Concluſion? We are directed in the Common-Prayer-Book to repeat the Confeſſion of Sins after the Miniſter with a <hi>meek, heart</hi> and <hi>humble voice:</hi> And I have heard of one, that, for his voice and confidence, was charged that he confeſſed his ſins as if he was proud of them?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have heard it bitterly complained of, that the Common Prayers which are good in themſelves, ſhould be abaſed by mean, pittifull, ſcandalous Readers, and be read in ſo ſlight and dull a manner. The Liturgy is not ordinarily, as to its effects on the generality of the Auditors, the ſame, when read by a worthy perſon, and in a grave and decent manner, as otherwiſe: yet I confeſs ſome reaſon why many men are not ſo much affected with the Common-Prayer is with the Miniſter's own Prayer, may be the frequent
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56448:40"/>repetition of the ſame prayers. I ſuppoſe where a man ſtrictly tieth himſelf to a Form of Prayer (though of his own compoſing) conſtantly before or after Sermon, it is not ordinarily ſo affecting or quickning to himſelf or others, as when he doth otherwiſe. I think Prayer by forms, and conceived prayers, both lawful, and both of them have their excellencies in ſome reſpects. That by a Form, excells in ſome reſpects Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer; in others, as I heard the Pious, Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Holdſworth</hi> when he was Vice-Chancellor (at the Commencement) at <hi>Cambridge</hi> determine the matter, though he concluded for the lawfulneſs and expediency of a Liturgy for Publick Worſhip; <hi>Such it the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man that he is ordinarily moſt excited in his affections, and his attention ſooneſt engaged and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Novelty or variety.</hi> And hear what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Perſon, no enemy to Epiſcopacy and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, ſaith of Prayer by Book; <hi>There is not that life and vigour in it to engage the affections, as when it proceeds immediately from the ſoul it ſelf, and is the natural expreſſion of thoſe particulars whereof we are moſt ſenſible.</hi> B. Ch. <hi>G. P. p.</hi> 12. Now one Reaſon being given in the Preface to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, why ſome Ceremonies are retained, being this, <hi>becauſe they are apt to affect the dull mind of man, &amp;c.</hi> why may not a Miniſter ſo order his Prayers before and after Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to voice and phraſe, as may moſt probably affect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56448:41"/>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and them that joyn in prayer with him? I do by no means approve of Romantick or Courtly expreſſions on the one hand in Prayer, nor Rude and Ruſtick expreſſions on the other. I think Scripture-phraſe is beſt, fitteſt, and of choice, therefore to be made uſe of. And to this (I think) I may ſafely ſay the generality of the Non-conformiſts do conform as much as the Conformiſts themſelves.</p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is to be thought of Afternoon-Sermons, is not that a thing wholly ſuperfluous, and would it not be better if as the Citizens and others have reduced their Families to one Meal a day; ſo the Miniſters would their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to one Sermon a day, and ſo have nothing beſides Common-Prayer and Catechiſm in the evening? <hi>Deb. p.</hi> 89. <hi>edit.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> in his Speech in Parliament, complained of ſome leading Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops before the Wars, that they cried up Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, to decry Preaching. Catechiſing indeed is talked of much, but by many 'tis to be feared, it is to juſtle out the Afternoon-Sermon out of doors: for we find in many Churches there is neither Preaching nor Catechiſing in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. Of old, preaching was accounted <hi>praecipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um munus Epiſcopi,</hi> the Biſhops chief Work or Office. Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> was very ſmart againſt Unpreaching Prelates in his time; but of later times the Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> in his ſpeech in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment charged ſome of that Order that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and diſcountenanced Preaching; that they preached not themſelves, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced them that would. And not long before the Wars, I heard a Friend, a Miniſter (that had been with his Dioceſan) who ſaid, <hi>That upon his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56448:42"/>quoting of Biſhop</hi> Davenant <hi>to the Biſhop, in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſomething he ſaid; the Biſhop replied,</hi> WHAT DO YOU TALK OF HIM, A PREACHING-COXCOMB! Biſhop <hi>Latimer, Ridley, Jewel,</hi> &amp;c. were great Patrons of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and themſelves practis'd it Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal</hi> went ſo far as to countenance the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings called Prophecyings; and Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> of late thought they might be profitable. Former Hiſtories did nor tell ſtories of any Biſhop of the Reformed Religion, that gave God thanks that he <hi>had not left one Lecture, or one afternoon-Sermon in all his Dioceſs.</hi> There was a Gentlewoman of good Quality, cited a Kingly Preacher, <hi>viz. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> for preaching in the Evening as well as Morning, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.6. <hi>In the morning ſow thy Seed, and in the Evening with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not thy hand.</hi> In the Country they account thoſe Shepheards moſt careful of their flocks, and to have uſually the beſt Sheep, who fothet twice a day. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts ro be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> a Sermon in the afternoon can be but out of ſeaſon. 'Tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Sermons at Court before Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were conſtantly in the afternoon. And I knew a Pariſh in the Country, where it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by the good women, <hi>That in caſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter would preach but once a day, it might be in the afternoon; becauſe, they ſaid, it might be a meant to keep their Husbands out of the Alehouſe.</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56448:42"/>The Morning Service according to the Common Prayer-Book being ſo long, they thought a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon might be better ſpared in the morning than in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Although preaching in the beginning of the planting the Chriſtian Religion might be neceſſary, yet is it ſo in theſe days?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Preaching ſerves not onely to inform the Underſtanding, but to excite and awaken the Affections, and to bring to remembrance what we have been taught before. <hi>Paul</hi> planted, and <hi>Apollos</hi> watered even there where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had firſt planted. A good Stomach can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt two Meals a day, and why may not a Soul of a healthful conſtitution have two Meals a Week. I believe the Chriſtians in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> have never the fatter Souls for going in lean Paſtures, for two Meals, I mean two Sermons a year.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Would it not be good Policy not to ſuffer any to preach, but onely to read Common Prayer and the Homilies? Would not this be an effectual way and means to prevent Errours and Hereſies, Rents and Diviſions amongſt us? Doth not this preaching ſow many Tares in the Field of the Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have heard of ſome Preachers indeed who preach down preaching, but I take them to be never a whit the better Preachers, nor the better Chriſtians for that; I acknowledge the Homilies to contain wholſom and very profitable
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56448:43"/>Doctrine, and think I ſhould ſpend my time better to heat one of them read, than to hear ſome Preachers now-a-days. But if ability to read the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Homilies, be all the Book-Learning neceſſary for a Miniſter, 'tis to be feared that ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Parliaments may come, before many Ages paſs who may be ſo thrifty as to be willing to ſave the needleſs expence of a million or two millions a year in Church-Maintenance; and think 20 <hi>l. per annum</hi> enough for men of ſuch Parts, Education, and Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is not Catechiſing the younger people in the afternoon, a very profitable and a laudable practice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I can ſay, I uſed It for many years together, beſides preaching uſually twice a day. 'Tis obſerved that the Proteſtants in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reformation, got advantage over the Papiſts, by their diligence in Catechiſing; and that ſince the <hi>Papiſts</hi> by their diligence the ſame way, have got ground of us. I am not againſt the uſe of the Church-Catechiſm for Children; and do really think the Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon</hi> hath deſerved well for bis Expoſition of it. But I confeſs I cannot approve of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car that in his Catechiſing, going about to juſtifie that Queſtion, <hi>What it thy Name?</hi> brought that Scripture for it, where 'tis recorded of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that he ſaid to the man poſſeſſed of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56448:43"/>the Devil, <hi>What is thy Name?</hi> and he anſwered, <hi>My Name is Legion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for the knowledge, of the Catechiſm (if it may lawfully be done) I could be glad none might be married before they give an account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Sith preaching is ſo neceſſary, what way of preaching is beſt? The Jingling way, or the Rational Philoſophical way, or the Rational Scripture way, with Reaſons out of Scripture, and Teſtimonies from Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I dare not commend the firſt way, which yet I ſuppoſe was more practis'd in former times than of late: Such as that was of Dr. <hi>Pl.</hi> on that place of the <hi>Canticles, My Bed is green;</hi> Typical, <hi>My;</hi> Topical, <hi>Bed;</hi> Tropical, <hi>green:</hi> Typical, Topical, Tropical; <hi>My Bed is green.</hi> Such as was that of the Doctor and Dignitary at <hi>Oxford</hi> about the loſt Groat; ſuch as was the mode of the Wits about thirty years ago; and ſuch as was well expreſſed and expoſed ſince by a Citizen or Countryman, who being asked how he liked the Sermon, and how the Miniſter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? Anſwered, He could not ſay much of it, but it ran or ſounded thus, as if he had ſaid,
<q>
                  <l>A Pudding, a Pie;</l>
                  <l>A Pudding-Pie:</l>
                  <l>A Pudding for thee,</l>
                  <l>A Pie, for me;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56448:44"/>A Pudding-Pie</l>
                  <l>For me and thee.</l>
               </q>
Nor do I look on him is one of the fineſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that lately exhorted his Hearers to put on <hi>the Sattin of Sincerity, the Purple of Purity, and the Silk of Simplicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Rational way, the mode of ſome great Doctors of theſe days, if they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix more of Scripture-Reaſon, or Scripture-Teſtimonies, it might be very profitable for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Auditories.</p>
            <p>As for the way by Doctrine, Reaſon, and Uſe, by Teſtimonies out of the holy Scriptures, more than Citations out of the Ancient Fathers, or by Reaſons deduced from Philoſophy, (ſuch as I apprehend was the preaching of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> old Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and many others in our days) I think it moſt edifying to ordinary Auditors: And this I conceive to be that which the Aſſembly mean in their Directory for preaching, and others in their Prayers before Sermon, by preaching <hi>in the evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit and of Power.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> in his Paraphraſe, and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this was the Divinity of former time. I do not hold it unlawful to ſerve God for fear of puniſhment, nor hopes of Reward; yet this I ſay, That fear alone ſpeaks a man a Servant, and love ſpeaks a min a Son: And thoſe are the beſt Servants to Vertue, who ſerve <hi>virtutis amore,</hi> for the love of Vertue. A man may hate the good he doth, and love the evil which he doth not do.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> adviſeth not to entertain good thoughts, if they prove a hindrance to a Chriſtian in his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> coming upon one of his neighbours, that was a Tanner, ſuddenly, and finding him taughing of a Hide; and the man excuſing himſelf for being found ſo: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter anſwered, <hi>I deſire Jeſus Chriſt may find me ſo, when he calls for me, or when he comes, that is, buſied about the works of my calling.</hi> I grant it is very commendable for perſons who have abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and have time and leiſure from buſineſs, and are in ſutable company, to be often ſpenking one to another of Chriſt and of Heaven, and to ſtir up one another to Faith, Love, and Good-works; God's People did thus in the Prophet <hi>Malachy's</hi> dayes, (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.) and they that did ſo, are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God's Jewels; but with us, at leaſt by many amongſt us, ſuch kind of perſons are as vile (though not ſo common) as the ſtones in the ſtreet. In other Religions they account of men the more and the better, the more religious they ſeem to be, and the more preciſe, ſtrict and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual they are in the obſervation of the Rules of their Religion: So the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſo the <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> account all Fools to be Saints: and many amongſt us account all Saints to be Fools, and the greater Saints the greater Fools.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Are not Nonconformiſts more preciſe than wiſe, in not allowing themſelves and others
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56448:59"/>the delights of Playes and other divertiſments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in his Geography obſerves that the Proteſtant Miniſters in <hi>France</hi> are ſo ſtrait-laced as not to allow of mixt dancing. The Nonconformiſts here are not all of this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they did not, do not uſe to enquire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſons approach unto the Lord's Table, whether or no, where, when, or how often they have danced? whether they go to ſee Comae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I my ſelf have been asked whether Dancing was lawful? I anſwered, Dancing was lawful; but whether mixt dancing was, they could tell better than I: If it was to them a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or incitement to evil, to them it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, elſe I dare not condemn it as ſinful; I will not make more ſins than the holy Scripture, and the Light of Nature has diſcovered to be ſo.</p>
            <p>As for Stage-Playes, if they were reformd and regulated, ſo as to have no curſing or ſwearing, nothing of laſciviouſneſs and wantonneſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of impiety or prophaneſs, no putting on of Apparel not belonging to be ſex by the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, I ſhould look on them as one of the beſt Recreations; only I would not have ſeeing of Playes be made a mans work or buſineſs, and that which ſhould be but a divertiſment be a man's whole imployment: But as they are frequently made and acted (if we may believe reports) the muſt have ſtronger Champions than I to throw down the Gantlet, or take it up in their defence.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56448:60"/>'Tis well known the Ancient Fathers of the Church, and ſome reverend and learned men, Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have condemned them. Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Doctor of the Chair at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> (and we are told a Conformiſt too) wrote againſt them; Dr. <hi>Andrew Rivet</hi> (Profeſſor of Divinity, and Tutor to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and one that remembred the condition of our Sovereign, when in Exile, in his laſt hours and Prayers) is no friend to them; And Dr.<hi>Fern,</hi> afterward Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> offered to joyn with ſome Presbyterian Miniſters, in declaring for the ſanctification of the Lord's day, and againſt Stage-playes in the late times. Yet as for thoſe that go to ſee them, I do not, I dare nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge them no Chriſtians, or no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe ſometimes they are ſeen in the Theatre, though oftener in the Church: I muſt confeſs that that inference [I may ſee a Picture, therefore a Play] is but weak and dark, and but the ſhadow of an Argument: For thoſe who condemn ſuch Repreſentations on the Stage, do the like in a Picture; that is, they damn laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious &amp; wanton Pictures, Books, &amp; Songs as well as Playes. Again, the ſeeing of a Picture good or bad, hath not (I conceive) ſuch a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on us, as the acting or perſonating on the Stage hath; We are not uſually ſo affected by reading of a Book as by heating a Speech; the voice and action ſpeak louder, and are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56448:60"/>heard, than a dumb ſhadow or a ſilent picture. However, to conclude this matter, I think the Author of the <hi>Friendly Debate</hi> had much better have ſpent his time in hearing or ſeeing of Plays, than in writing of that Treatiſe; yea that he might as well, and to as good purpoſe have gone about to find out the <hi>wandring Jew</hi> (he ſpeaks of) as to find Evidence to prove the generality of Nonconformiſt-Miniſters neither good Subjects, nor good Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What then, do you think that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>F. Debate</hi> was not well imployed in writing theſe Books, and in diſcovering the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and childiſhneſs of Mr. <hi>T. W</hi>'s Writings, or the falſeneſs and dangerouſneſs of Mr. <hi>W. B.</hi> his Books to the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> I have heard that he hath written divers uſeful Books; and I ſuppoſe in that Book or Books criticiſed upon, might have been found matter as well as phraſes, and ſome great as well as little things: and if a man had a mind to carp and cavil at other mens works, as the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> doth, he might pull ſome of the Fathers by the Beards, and tell them alſo they have written very child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly. All men write not in the ſame (We and phraſe, or in the like method; as all Cooks dreſs not the ſame joynt of meat with the ſame ſauce, and garniſh not the diſh in the ſame manner when they ſend it up. And ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56448:61"/>and Auditors like one way of writing or ſpeaking; ſome another; (elſe what need ſuch variety of Gifts?) but all tend to the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church. The Scholar is taken with one way of preaching or writing, the Citizen with another, the Countryman with another. Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farrel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Viret,</hi> all three, had their Excellencies, one in this way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and another in that: If the Doctrine which is preached or printed, be ſound and wholſome, what though the ſtile and phraſe be not compleat and polite? If thy meat be good and ſavory, what though not ſerved up in a Lordly Diſh? I had rather have wholſome Food in an Earthen Platter, than Poyſon in a Golden Charger. I ſuppoſe all <hi>Conformiſts</hi> have not the ſame low opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Mr. <hi>T. W.</hi> if it be true which I heard, that one of them preached one of his Printed Sermons, and that a Citizen his Auditor, after Sermon went to him with a <hi>Thank you Mr. Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for your pains.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he do, I leave him to apologize for himſelf, I will be no Advocate in ſuch matters; And if he doth, he is condemned by thoſe of his own way, I mean our Brethren of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church; Twenty nine Miniſters of that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56448:61"/>Judgement, as to Church-Goverment, being in and about the City, publiſhed a Renunciation and Declaration againſt the horrid Inſurrection and Rebellion acted by <hi>Venner</hi> and his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to which they ſubſcribed their Names: In concluſion of which, they declare as followeth, <hi>We ceaſe not to pour out our hearty prayers for all ſorts of Bleſſings, ſpiritual and temporal, upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government of his Majesty, both in our Congregations, Families, and Retirements; and through Gods grace, according to our Duties, ſhall continue ſo to do our ſelves, and to perſwade others thereunto; and to live quietly and peaceably, in all Godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> And as to the Actings and Reſolutions of <hi>Venner</hi> and his party, they ſay, <hi>The Instruments of Cruelty are in their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Curſed be their Anger, for it was fierce; and their Wrath, for it wat cruel. And we each one ſay, O my Soul, come not thou into their Secrets; unto their Aſſemblies, mine Honour, be not thou united: But let God divide them in Jacob, and ſcatter them in Iſrael.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bridge</hi> was not in Town then, which may be ſuppoſed the Reaſon we find not his Name amongſt the Subſcribers.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>W. B.</hi> whether his Writings be ſo faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as they are charged to be in the <hi>Debates,</hi> I cannot tell, having not read them; but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Doctor told me, that he had ſearched them, and that the Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> had dealt diſingeniouſly in his quotations of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> May not every whit as much be ſaid for the Papiſts, why they ſhould be tolerated, as to the publick exerciſe of their Religion, as for <hi>Nonconformiſts?</hi> Do not they profeſs all Loyalty to his Majeſty, and declare againſt all Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Papiſts depend upon a forraign Power in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, ſuperiour (as they think) to his Majeſty. And it was ſubſcribed by twelve Biſhops in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as follows: <hi>Their Religion is ſuperſtitious and idolatrous, their Faith and Doctrine erronious and heretical, their Church in reſpect of both, Apoſtatical.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> whether <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Congregationiſts,</hi> agree with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith and Sacraments, differ not in any ſubſtantial part of Religion from her. What the Papiſts practice hath been, how dangerous to the Civil Peace, the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, can tell us. That <hi>'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Nation to be free from Troubles or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo long as they ſuffer Jeſuites amongſt them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Watſon</hi> in his <hi>Quodlibets.</hi> And that he and his Order were not ſo good and loyal as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, may be gueſſed from hence, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was afrerwards executed for Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Moreover Papiſts cannot, when they have power, long live without perſecuting Proteſtants, ſaith a Reverend Doctor: Hence may appear that we ſee <hi>K. H. III.</hi> of <hi>France, ſtabb'd and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56448:62"/>lamn'd, becauſe he would not perſecute them enough.</hi> So the Anſwer to the <hi>Papiſts Apology,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Quakers,</hi> they may ſeem to be the very Spawn of the Romiſh Emiſſaries, proſelyted by them, but made more dangerous to Magiſtrates, and all Civil Society, by this one Principle that they hold, <hi>viz. That they ought to be guided and to act, not by the Scripture, nor according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Civil Magiſtrate, or Spiritual Guides and Paſtors; but by and ſudden Flaſh or Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them.</hi> I am not ſatisfied to have a hand in the Execution of the Sanguinary Laws againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, yet ſhould be loth to try how Sanguine or good natur'd they would be, if they had power in their hands to execute the Writ <hi>De Haeretico comburendo.</hi> If we may ſay of them, (as they uſe to ſay of Fire and Water) <hi>They are good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> I am ſure 'tis as true, <hi>That they are but bad Maſters.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The greater number of them, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, ſpeak as others do; and conform to that ordinary phraſe, <hi>Well, I thank God.</hi> If any when enquired of about their Health, ſay, <hi>I am well, through Mercy;</hi> they do but as the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56448:63"/>do; they are ſurely few in compariſon that ſay ſo commonly; and I do not remember one Miniſter that uſeth to ſay ſo; they that do, poſſibly have recovered from ſome ſickneſs, or eſcaped ſome danger, which occaſions them to uſe this expreſſion: But if you will be critical, ſome think it a ſign of a greater humility to ſay, <hi>I am well through mercy,</hi> than the other, <hi>I am well I thank God;</hi> However it is not ſo liable to exception as to ſay, <hi>I am well y' faith,</hi> as I have heard that ſome Conformiſts do, although Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Saunderſon</hi> doth not approve of that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in common diſcourſe.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> printed a Book on <hi>Daniel's</hi> Viſions and Propheſies, <hi>Anno</hi> 1646. and according to him there will be no ſhutting of Heaven, no turning of Waters into Blood, at leaſt no putting off of the VVitneſſes Sackcloth (which ſaith our Author (<hi>Contin. of Fr.

I am told, Thoſe that preach in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, preach Faith and Repentance, and meddle not with matters relating to the Government ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Church or State. And I was lately ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a prime Nonconformiſt, and an able Preacher, what he ſaid to that Objection in the <hi>Debate,</hi> that the <hi>Nonconformiſts did not preach up Obedience to Magiſtrates?</hi> He very zealouſly and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied, <hi>They did it, and that more than the Conformists themſelves.</hi>

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:56448:66"/>them ſo much as it doth us; and in the times they lived, they were likely accuſed as we are now: When we are as they now, really (as well as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally) dead, it may be we may have a good word alſo.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> were not more pliant or complying, than they are now. There were not the Tythe of the Miniſters then ejected, to what ſince. There were more bitter Books put out then againſt the Hierarchy, than are now. If I miſ-remember not, the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> gave the firſt Charge then, but now-a-days we are alarum'd and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted once and again, and no man appeared publickly to defend our Principles or Practices. We are loaded with Reproaches, and many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and heavy things laid to our charge, and no man for a long time in our name in print ſo much as pleaded Not Guilty, and offered to Traverſe the Indictment, or put himſelf upon the Tryal of his Country. Say not therefore that the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> of former times were better, more peaceable, more modeſt then theſe.</p>
            <p>If any man, though in the heat of his paſſion, and in the heat of the War, have called the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> Gentiles, Uncircumciſed, <hi>Philiſtines, Egyptians, Babylonians,</hi> the Brood of the Serpent, and have denied pardon of ſin and Heaven to them becauſe of their Conformity, I think he ought to repent of ſuch hard ſayings, and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56448:67"/>Cenſures of his Brethren and Fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to bring forth Fruits meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the time to come, <hi>viz.</hi> To lay a Law of Love and Kindneſs upon his Tongue and Pen, as long as he lives. 'Tis to be hoped the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that had ſuch unbridled Tongues and Pens, was very ſmall; the inſtances you bring of ſuch intemperate heats, and irregular zeal, are taken out of the Furnace of the late War; and that too, after the fire had been raked up in Aſhes by many years peace, and fully quenched by the Act of Oblivion and Indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If we had a mind to recriminate and retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, we could repeat much foul Language, and bitter reviling ſpeeches, by ſome of your way againſt us alſo. But theſe are not the methods of Peace. I deſire therefore that all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be forgiven and forgotten on both ſides, and remembred onely or chiefly by the Anthors and Abettors of them, that they may, if they have not already, repent of them more than in Duſt and Aſhes.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56448:67"/>Miniſters I mean, ſuch as ſhould be like <hi>John Baptist,</hi> burning and ſhining Lights amongſt them. The Scotiſh Presbyterians, if they be like their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> had a Reverend eſteem of Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Iriſh Articles of Religion, and their zeal againſt the toleration of Popery there. Who or what was the cauſe of the ſcarcity of able Miniſters, except want of Maintenance, and fear of the Iriſh Papiſts, I know not; but confident I am, the Biſhops of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagh</hi> were not, if any other Biſhops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Have not the Nonconformiſts a high conceit of themſelves, and thoſe of their own way, and a low eſteem of all others for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Godlineſs?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have heard that Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> had ſo much charity for <hi>Corvinus,</hi> that he ſaid, <hi>He did not doubt but to meet him in Heaven:</hi> Why then Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> paſſeth, and Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> approveth ſuch a ſmart Cenſure on the Biſhops Families, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell. Yet 'tis not to be imagined that Mr. <hi>P. Baynes</hi> meant that the Biſhops had no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their Families; If ſo, I cannot commend his Charity. I think this is a ſure and clear truth, That neither Biſhops not ſilenced Miniſters can
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56448:68"/>be ſaid to have all Religion or no Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them and their Followers. I hold a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly in Religion as unlawful, as ſome have thought thoſe in the State illegal. Never the-leſs it muſt be confeſſed, That the Articles of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, or the Injunctions of the Great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are Canonical: <hi>A Biſhop must rule his own Houſe well; for if a man know not how to rule his own Houſe, how ſhall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> 1 Tim. 3.4, 5. He that writes the Life of Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> tells us, That he had four times a day Prayer in his Houſe; that there was an hour ſpent in Catechiſing once a Week, <hi>viz.</hi> every <hi>Fryday;</hi> that he had on the Lords day in the Evening the Sermon which he preached in the Morning, repeated in his Chappel by one of his Chaplains. This was the way to have a Church in his Houſe. All Biſhops do not write after this Canon, nor this Copy. I know a Miniſter, a learned, ſober, and zealous Conformiſt, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been with his Dioceſan, at his Houſe or Palace, to ſubſcribe; came home with a ſad heart, and profeſſed it was not for any thing he had done, but for the prophaneſs and diſorder he obſerved in the Biſhops Family amongſt his Servants. 'Tis to the great commendation of the preſent Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that which is reported of him, That he keeps a good Houſe; that is, in Biſhop <hi>Goodman</hi>'s Dialect, he ſpends Church-Means in a Churchly manner: And that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56448:68"/>he keeps a well-govern'd Houſe, allows not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery; if a Servant be drunk once, there's no place for a ſecond Error. If ſo, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that there is Diſcipline in that School, where nothing ſaves but a <hi>primum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>

            <p>

The King is bound to maintain the Rights of the Clergy, whilſt they continue ſuch; but if any if their Rights be abrogated by juſt Power, he stands no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that particular.</hi> If any Priviledges of the Clergy, prove prejudicial or contrariant to the Laws and Liberties and Priviledges of the People, which the King is bound to maintain, the King may lawfully relieve his other Subjects, by paſſing ſuch Bills as may take away ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. His Majeſties Oath firſt made to his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56448:69"/>Subjects in general, being lawful, cannot be voided or ſuperſeded by his after-Oath to the Clergy. And as for the Laws about Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they are not like thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> unchangable; but may be changed, and the Rites and Ceremonies now in uſe, may be aboliſhed by the ſame power by which they were here eſtabliſhed.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Laws that are lawful and neceſſary to the <hi>Eſſe</hi> or Being of the Church or State, are doubtleſs to be put in execution; not ſo thoſe always, that tend to Order and Decency.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> in the ſame Treatiſe, proteſts in their Name, as followeth: <hi>We never refuſed Obedience to any haves or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the King or State whatſoever, but onely to ſuch as we have proved, or are ready to prove, if we might be heard, to be contrary to the Word of God. And we are ready to take our ſolemn Oaths before the Throne of Juſtice, That the onely Cauſe of our refuſal of Obedience to thoſe Canons of the Prelates, for which roe are at preſent ſo extremely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, is meer Conſcience, and a fear to ſin againſt God. And if by due form of Reaſoning, we may be convinced in our Conſciences of the cannery, we

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was the conſcience of an Oath, and a care to prevent the great guilt of Perjury, that made Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> one of the late Aſſembly, when Vice-Chancelor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in thoſe dayes, to inſert thoſe explanatory clauſes in the Oaths of thoſe who took degrees,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is there not a good riddance of ſo many Mr. Scruples out of the Church? And is there any want of able Preachers up and down in the Country now they are ejected?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his dayes, thought there was a ſcarcity of able Preachers, and yet there were not the tythe perhaps of Miniſters ſilenced then, to what are now. And be thought then that the ſilencing of the Miniſters for their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> was a puniſhment of the People rather than of the Miniſter. He conceived then alſo that ſuch Subſcriptions might have been forborn as occaſioned the ſilencing of divers of thoſe Miniſters. <hi>Conſ. ab Eccl. Aff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What if there were many places made void by the ejectment of <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> may not thoſe places be well filled by <hi>Conforming-Pluraliſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In caſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of able Miniſters were ſufficient, and the value of the Benefices were ſufficient, then Pluralities were in no ſort tolerable. And as for Nonreſidents, except it be juſt of neceſſary abſence,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it ſeemeth to be an abuſe drawn out of covetouſneſs and ſloth; for that men ſhould live of the Flock they do not feed, or at the Altar whereat they do not ſerve,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56448:71"/>is a thing that can hardly receive juſt defence. And to exerciſe the Office of a Paſtor in matter of Word and Doctrine by deputation is a thing not warranted.</hi> So he in his Treatiſe dedicated to King <hi>James</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eccleſiaſt. Affairs. For my own part, I think the Poligamy of the Fathers or the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of old, as excuſable as the Spiritual Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy of many of the Sons of our Church. And to ſerve Cures of Souls meerly by Proxies and Deputies (beſides that it may ſeem to ſtrengthen the Pope's plea for Univerſal Paſtors) whilſt ſo many ſtand idle in the Market-place, able and willing to take care of thoſe Souls, is a thing I ſhall not take upon me to juſtifie.</p>
            <p>Let me add this alſo, that 'tis one Objection which hath been formerly made againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, That it occaſions an ignorant, dumb, and a lazy Miniſtry, but were it not for Pluralities and Non-reſidency and inſufficient Livings, there might be no place for ſuch objection.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> tells us in his <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, p.</hi> 383. <hi>that at firſt the chief promoters of ſtinted Liturgies were renowned for their conſtant and unwearied preaching every day in the week, and ſomeeimes twice; and as probably this was one thing that advanced the credit and eſteem of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies in former times:</hi> As I am perſwaded one great cauſe why many do not eſteem of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy ſo much now, is, that ſo many great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and ſticklers for it are <hi>Pluraliſts</hi> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56448:72"/>
               <hi>Nonreſidents;</hi> and divers of them either preach not at all, or very ſeldom; and then too, ſome of them preach againſt Preaching, and ſaw down the branch of that Tree upon which they ſtand ſo high above their Brethren. And on the other ſide, thoſe who ſcruple ſome things in the Liturgy and Ceremonies, are ſuch conſtant and zealous Preachers, and that when Bonds and Impriſonments abide them for their ſo doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is it not indeed the Bond of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Scottiſh Covenant,</hi> wherewith our Engliſh Presbyterians have bound their Souls, the great or onely Cauſe that makes ſo many <hi>Nonconformists?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Covenant</hi> mentioned was not the cauſe of the War; the Battel at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> was fought before the <hi>Covenant</hi> came into <hi>England.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Covenant</hi> was enter'd into in <hi>Forty Two,</hi> and <hi>Forty Three,</hi> there have been <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ever ſince Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> and the Reformation in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's days. There are ſome amongſt the Covenanters that can conform to the Liturgy, and ſubmit to Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government. And the greater part of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> Preachers at this day, never took the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is the reaſon that divers Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts read Logick in private Houſes? Is not this contrary to their Oath takes in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity? <hi>Cont. p.</hi> 10. <hi>edit.</hi> 4.</p>

               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:56448:72"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have conſulted as able as any in the Univerſities (and by their Offices as likely to know as any) about the matter, and am told, That the Oath there prohibits the ſetting up of another Univerſity in Oppoſition to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and Reading in order to the taking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees elſewhere. The words are at <hi>Oxford,</hi> They ſhall not <hi>ſolennes Lectiones reſumere;</hi> which doth not make Dr. <hi>Busby</hi> perjured for initiating his Scholars ſome time in Logick before they go to the Univerſity. Nor the ſeveral Profeſſors at <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> who read as ſolemn Lectures ſurely, as a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> doth in a private houſe. Beſides, I hear but of one Nonconformiſt that at preſent doth teach Youth in that manner pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What ſecurity can his Majeſty and the Parliament have, that Nonconformiſts will not (under pretence of Conſcience or Covenant) ſeditiouſly endeavour an Alteration of Church-Government; but that they will live quietly and peaceably in their places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are ready to give the ancient Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal-Security, the Oaths of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; and that is more than the Papiſts will do, and as much as is required of the generality of the reſt of the Nation, notwithſtanding their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Engagement in the late times, which yet many Presbyterians, now Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Ejected Miniſters, would never do,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56448:73"/>though ſome of them loſt their Places for their refuſal. Moreover many of them ſince have taken an Oath not to endeavour any Alteration of Government in Church and State, and yet are not truſted to preach publickly, much leſs to enjoy any Eccleſiaſtical Benefice. And the reſt that ſcruple ſome words or phraſes in that Oath, are yet ready, beſides the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, to ſwear that they will live quietly and peaceably in their places, and not under colour or pretence of the Covenant, or any pretence whatever, endeavour by force, or ſediciouſly and tumultuouſly, any Alteration of Government in Church and State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is the Act of <hi>Uniformity,</hi> and the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Act, to be ſtrictly and rigorouſly preſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and executed on all tranſgreſſors?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be, then what will become of many <hi>Conformiſts</hi> who uſe other Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies than what are by Law required? and of them who uſe other Forms of Prayer then are there preſcribed; and of all thoſe Miniſters that do not reade the Common-Prayer either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly or privately, morning and evening; and ſo thoſe Lecturers who do not monthly reade their Aſſent &amp; Conſent? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Act &amp; Oath, I have heard from a very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon, a Conformiſt, that the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves come within the compaſs of it, as many as have not aſſented and conſented, &amp;c. as oft as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56448:73"/>they came within five miles of their Sees, or any ther Corporation. This I ſay, not to bring the Biſhops <hi>within,</hi> but to bring others <hi>out</hi> of the reach of that Act; or rather to encline, if it nay be, our Fathers and Brethren to uſe their intereſt with his Majeſty and Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe Laws which are a Partition-wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Nonconformiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But are not the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſinners and tranſgreſſors of the Divine Law, as oft as they withdraw from actual communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being (as many of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) a true Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Many of our learned Doctors hold <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church; as a Woman is a true Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though an Harlot; and a Man a true Man, though overſpread with Leproſie. And yet being we cannot actually hold external communion with them, without either ſubſcribing to many falſe Tenets, or joyning in a corrupt and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Service, we withdraw from them without ſin. Our withdrawing is not to be charged with ſin or ſchiſm, although too we were the <hi>minor</hi> part who withdrew, and againſt the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a pretended General Councel. And I believe it would be a hard matter to prove that many of thoſe Meetings, which are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Conventicles,</hi> want any of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential requiſites to a true Church, and yet do not think themſelves Schiſmaticks for not hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56448:74"/>actual communion with them, becauſe not countenanced by the Law. And if a Legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment be abſolutely neceſſary to the being of a true Chriſtian Church, then there was no true Church at <hi>Rome</hi> till <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> dayes; which I ſuppoſe you will judge very unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to aſſert.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it poſſible there ſhould be Unity without Uniformity in Rites and Ceremonies, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes. There is Unity amongſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, that follow <hi>Calvin,</hi> and yet divers forms of Prayer, and divers Rites. The Author of the <hi>Debate</hi> will not take it well, if a man ſhould not ſay, there is Unity at home amongſt Conformiſts, and yet the Cathedrals and Country-Pariſh-Churches differ in ſome Rites, and in their mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and in the Pariſh-Churches there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Ceremonies and Uſages in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. In ſome Churches they ſtand up at the Hymns, in others not; In ſome they reade the Hymns and Pſalms Miniſter and People <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphonatim,</hi> in others not: In ſome, in moſt, they reade the Prayer for Chriſts Catholick Church, if at all, before Sermon, but I know where 'tis conſtantly read after. And it is well known that none boaſt more of Unity than the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and yet in ſeveral Countries they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rites, Cuſtoms, and Priviledges: and in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56448:74"/>
               <hi>England</hi> before the happy Reformation, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was <hi>ad modum Sarum,</hi> and <hi>ad modum Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi> different in divers Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it not neceſſary to appoint the ſame Veſtures and Geſtures for the Worſhip of God, to avoid difference and confuſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no Geſture or Ceremony pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the ſinging of Pſalms, and yet Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally are bare and reverend in that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p>The late Canons in 1640. leave Bowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt of Altar indifferent; and would not have thoſe that do it, to judge thoſe that do it not; nor thoſe that do it not, to judge thoſe that do it. Now what greater inconvenience would follow, if the ſame moderation and liberty to practiſe differently, were uſed as to the Croſs, Surplice, and Kneeling at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?</p>
            <p>If there muſt be abſolute and univerſal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the Worſhip of God amonſt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, then all muſt alike have their Faces one way, muſt wear all Garments of the ſame faſhion and colour. In the late Times, when the Liturgy and Ceremonies were diſuſed, there were not a quarter of thoſe <hi>private Meetings</hi> that have been ſince. The number of them that ſeparated from the Publick Worſhip, were very ſmall in compariſon; I ſuppoſe not ten to an hundred. The Author of the <hi>Debate,</hi> I gueſs,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56448:75"/>and hundreds, if not thouſands, of Conformiſts, did not hold themſelves bound, notwithſtanding the Laws for Liturgy and Ceremonies, to <hi>abſent</hi> themſelves from the then Publick Worſhip, and <hi>aſſemble privately,</hi> that they might uphold <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in Forms of Prayer, Rites and Ceremonies:</hi> Whence we may <hi>reaſonably</hi> conclude, That they thought Gods Publick Worſhip might be carried on without Uniformity in theſe things: And again, That the omiſſion of things required by <hi>Law,</hi> is not judged ſo great a ſin as is by them pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest</hi> Did not <hi>Presbyterians</hi> decry all Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and refuſe to tolerate <hi>Independents? See Cont. p.</hi> 224.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> both old and modern, are againſt Separation: They deny that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from you; for upon occaſion they joyn with you in Ordinances, and if you remove ſome things wherewith your Worſhip is clogg'd, they would joyfully communicate conſtantly with you. The preſent partial and temporary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, as to ſome Acts of Worſhip, is not to be charged with Schiſm. If you hold forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with your Church as in the Apoſtles days, with a Liturgy ſufficiently corrected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Symbolical Ceremonies, without ſuch Oaths, Declarations and Subſcriptions, they will come into your Boſom, though you not onely caſt them out of your Lap, but thruſt them out of your
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56448:75"/>Houſe, and ſhut the Doors upon them. As we juſtifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> from Schiſm, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Separation from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> will endeavour to juſtifie their withdrawings in ſome Acts, and for a time only; by reaſon of the terms of Communion impoſed on them. That they are for Reformation, not Separation, may be hence concluded, That in a late project for Peace and Agreement, this was one Propoſition given in by the Presbyterians themſelves, <hi>That whoſoever ſhould be capable of any Employment, ſhould profeſs to hold Communion with the Church of England, and to the uttermoſt of his power to promote the Peace and Happineſs thereof.</hi> And when there was a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and their Brethren, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Independents,</hi> formerly, there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference before a Committee of Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, in which the Presbyterians (as I am credibly informed) offered either to give or take: that is to ſay, They would take the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and allow their Brethren of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational-way a well-regulated Toleration; or let their Brethren take the Eſtabliſhment, and allow the Presbyterians ſuch a Toleration. And one of the chief of them, when the <hi>London</hi>-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters waited on his Majeſty at the <hi>Hague,</hi> when diſcourſe was about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly moved his Majeſty, that he would pleaſe to think of a way to indulge them a Liberty,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56448:76"/>though they ſhould not be comprehended in the Publick Eſtabliſhment, as it was then hoped the Presbyterian would have been.</p>
            <p>In brief, the Presbyterians diſclaim Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are willing to have Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and friendly Terms: And they deſire the like Liberty and Toleration from the Biſhops, that they were willing and ready to have ſhewed to their Brethren of the Congregational Way: Yea, they would bleſs God and our Governours, if they might have the like Favours and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hide,</hi> and others the <hi>Now-Conformiſts</hi> had in former times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the Presbyterians are willing to conform to a Liturgy, and to this Liturgy when ſufficiently corrected; yet what hopes is there that ever there ſhould be any Alteration or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of it, which will ſatisfie or pleaſe them, ſo as to uſe it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, there is ſuch a draught already made, to the great content of the chief of the Presbyterians; and this done by three Reverend perſons, all Conformiſts: And which I hope may be produced, when ever Authority ſhall pleaſe to command it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Would it not be accounted a weak thing to yeild or condeſcend, though never ſo little, if this might be a means to cement and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us together again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:56448:76"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was the prudence of the ancient Church to ſatisfie the <hi>Joannites,</hi> who had kept Conventicles apart from the Church for thirty years, being diſguſted at the diſhonour done to <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> their Biſhop or Paſtor; and this the Church did, by reſtoring his honour after he was dead. <hi>Socrat. Eccleſ. Hist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why ſhould the Church of <hi>England</hi> remove the Ceremonies which ſhe hath retained ſince the Reformation? May ſhe not thereby diſguſt and offend the Romaniſts, to pleaſe the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> which they call Puritans rather than Proteſtants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Ceremonies were at firſt retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued when others were caſt out of the Church in hopes to bring the Papiſts to a compliance with our Church: But Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> as he that writes his Life informs us, upon occaſion declared his Judgement concerning them, That experience of many years hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this condeſcention hath rather hardned them in their Error, than brought them to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our Religion; this being their uſual ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If our Fleſh be not good, why do you drink of our Broth?</hi> If the Church ſtick cloſe to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſhe is not like to gain our Adverſaries the Romaniſts to our Communion; if ſhe lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Ceremonies, ſhe may gain thouſands and ten thouſands of our Brethren to our Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. That they may do thus, God grant that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56448:77"/>the ſame mind might be in all our Biſhops, that was in Chriſt Jeſus, the chief Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of our Souls; that they may love and feed their Sheep, and be ready to lay down their lives for their Sheep; and then their Yoak will be eaſie, and their Burden light. Or that was in the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> on whom was the Care of all the Churches; who profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>I became all things to all men, that by any means I might win ſome.</hi> Or elſe that was in this Godly Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> of whom 'tis recorded in his Life, That though he conformed himſelf, yet he deſired that his Majeſty would not impoſe the Engliſh Ceremonies on the Iriſh Church; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>If I had all mens Conſciences in my keeping, I could in theſe diſputable Caſes give Laws unto them as well as my ſelf: But 'tis one thing what I can do, and another thing what other men must do.</hi> Since the Ceremonies be things (ſaith our Church) in their own nature indifferent, and yet by ſome held ſuperſtitious and unlawful, it ſeemeth to fall within the Apoſtles Rule, which is, <hi>That the ſtrong do deſcend and yeild to the weaker;</hi> if we will hearken to the Counſel of the Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> in his Conſiderations touching the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Doth the holy Scripture caution us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt grieving our Brethren, as well as againſt offending of them, ſo as to occaſion them to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall into ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56448:77"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis our duty not onely to prevent out Brothers fall, but his fears; and to keep his heart from ſinking, as well as his feet from falling. <hi>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.22. 'Tis the part of a good Shepherd to carry the Lambs in his Arms, and gently to lead the Ewes that are great with young; and of Nurſing Fathers and Mothers, to be tender-hearted and tender-handed towards Babes, towards weak and young Children. If it be ſaid, We muſt not grieve or vex the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: I anſwer, 'Tis true, we muſt not; but if the Magiſtrate pleaſe to remove the Law; where there's no Law, there's no Diſobedience; and then the Offence ceaſeth: And where there's no Offence committed by the Inferiour, there ſhould be no Offence taken by the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; or when there is none given, there ſhould be none taken. The things are alterable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Magiſtrate is a Miniſter of God for good; and if he ſhall pleaſe to remove every ſtumbling-ſtone and grieving-thorn out of the way to the Church, and out of the way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, How ſhall God and his people bleſs him? All the power that the Church hath, it is to edification, and not to deſtruction; and there's a far greater neceſſity of Unity, than of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: 'Tis a great deal better not to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, than to make ſuch as we fore-ſee will be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56448:78"/>broken by thouſands, and that under a pretence of Conſcience, and who are ſerious, ſober, civil people in their Lives and Converſations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What may be thought the readieſt way to make the Biſhops work eaſie, and his perſon to be beloved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis I think to uſe Moderation, to rule with Love, and not with Rigor; and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome young Counſellors, ſome Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurs, may adviſe them, as of old the young men did <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> when their Brethren come to them, and ſay, <hi>Your Fore-fathers</hi> (or your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors divers of them) <hi>made our Yoke grievous: Now therefore make ye, we pray you, the grievous Service of your Fore-fathers, and their heavy Yoke which they put upon us, lighter, and we will ſerve you:</hi> To ſay to them, <hi>Our little Finger ſhall be heavier than our Fore-fathers Loyns; and now whereas they did lade you with a heavy Yoke, we will adde to your Yoke: Our Fore-fathers chaſtiſed you with Whips, but we will chaſtiſe you with Scorpions.</hi> The deeper you lay the Foundation in Humility, and the broader in Charity, the higher you may probably build your Houſe, and it may likewiſe ſtand the longer. A well-grounded <hi>Jus Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> may ſtand longer than a high-built preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Jus Divinum. And Reaſon ſhews,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>that Epiſcopacy will stand more firm in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Presbytery, than by it ſelf alone. There be two circumstances;</hi> ſaith my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56448:78"/>
               <hi>Bacon, wherein I could never be ſatisfied; the one, the ſole exerciſe of their Authority; the other, the deputation of their Authority. For the firſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>ſurely I do ſuppoſe (and I think upon good ground) that</hi> ab initio non fuit ita. <hi>And that the Deans and Chapters were Counſels about the Seas and Chairs of Biſhops at the firſt, and were unto them a Presbytery or Conſiſtory. And again, we ſee that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome (Fas eſt &amp; ab hoſte doceri, <hi>and no queſtion in that Church the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were excellent) performeth all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, in Conſiſtory, with advice, that is, of the Cardinals or Pariſh-Priests of</hi> Rome. <hi>And hereof again</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ſee divers ſhadows yet remaining: as that the Dean and Chapter</hi> profor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ <hi>chooſeth the Biſhop, which is the higheſt point of Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The ſame Author tells us, that <hi>the Biſhop is a Judge, and of a high nature; Whence cometh it that he ſhould depute, conſidering that all truſt and confidence is perſonal and inherent, and cannot or ought not to be tranſpoſed? ſurely in this again</hi> ab initio non fuitita: <hi>But it is probable that Biſhops when they gave themſelves too much to the glory of the World, and became Grandees in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and great Counſellors to Princes, then did they leave their proper Juriſdiction, as things of too inferior a nature for their greatneſs; And then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſimilitude and immitation of Kings and Counts-Palatine, they would have their Chancellors and Judges.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Time was when Reverend and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> (that loſt the Maſterſhip of <hi>Pembroke-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> becauſe he would
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56448:79"/>not ſubſcribe the Engagement; as did alſo Dr. <hi>Spurſtow</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Katherine-Hall,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Young</hi> of <hi>Jeſus-Colledge</hi> for the ſame cauſe preaching before the Parliament, ſaid, <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward he ſhould take Antichrist for a better man than ever he thought him to be, there were ſo many good things charged upon him.</hi> And another Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, now a <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> preaching to the ſame Auditors, preached that <hi>Antichriſtian and Babylonian, were terms ſooner imputed or charged, than proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Nonconforming-Miniſters</hi> or <hi>People</hi> were yet ignorant, and to ſeek for ſcoffing and reviling language, they might have a Dictionary of ſuch hard words out of the <hi>Friendly Debate.</hi> If there be in Private-meetings that uſe railing and reviling ſpeeches (as too many too often have is publick Congregations) I would rather adviſe people to ſit quietly at home, if they will not go to Church, than to go or ſtep out of doors to learn their language. I do not love a biting tongue; and I take a black mouth to be as venemous in a man, as 'tis accounted wholſom in a dog. And if there be any printed Book wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h ſuch railing ſpeeches or phraſes in them, (I will promiſe you) it ſhall never have my <hi>Imprima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> without an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> in the next Edition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is the Divinity of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> a Phraſe-Divinity? and in caſe their Books and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56448:80"/>Sermons are not fill'd with foul language, is there any thing beſides fine words, and new phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was ſomething beſides words in the <hi>Old Nonconformiſts,</hi> witneſs the writings of Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw,</hi> &amp;c. And doubtleſs there is matter, and that good matter and ſound ſpeech, that need not to be aſhamed, in the Writings of <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> of this Generation, witneſs the Books written by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Manton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caryll,</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool, &amp;c.</hi> they hold to Scripture-expreſſions, and to the terms of ſound words, which they have received from the moſt ſerious ſolid pious Biſhops and Doctors of the Chair, Profeſſors at home and abroad in former times; yea, the Nonconforming-Presbyterians and Congregational Miniſters profeſs to agree with our Articles of Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in all things concerning the Doctrine of Faith and Ceremonies: And is all this but Phraſe-Divinity!</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Debate,</hi> and divers other of the preſent Conformiſts may as juſtly be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for new Divinity, new minted words in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, new phraſes and modes of expreſſing themſelves in Sermons and Writings, and theſe too leſs conform to the language of the holy Scripture, our own Articles and Homilies, the Harmony of Confeſſions of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56448:80"/>and our ancient Biſhops and Doctors. The Author of the <hi>Debate,</hi> though he ſeems to be the Biſhops Advocate, yet his Writings ſhew him more an <hi>Epiſcopian</hi> than an <hi>Epiſcopalian;</hi> and 'tis eaſie to ſee from what forge they have their new Divinity and new Theological Dictionary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Were not the Nonconformiſts the cauſe of the ſtrange and new Doctrines and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and of phantaſtical words and phraſes in preaching and writing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant the taking down the old Mound or Hedge, and not ſetting a new one in the room, was an occaſion that many erronious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, like wild beaſts, did get into the Vineyard, and that ſome ſtrange Doctrines, Phancies, Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Whimſes were vented in the Times of War and late Confuſions; but I ſay, that theſe things are not to be charged upon the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians:</hi> for if they had had power to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and purpoſes, they would doubtleſs have raiſed up a Mound or Fence againſt ſuch Errors, Fancies and Follies, as ſtrong as that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment removed. I have heard it obſerved, that of all Churches, no Church hath had fewer Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Heterodoxies ſpring up, or at leaſt proſper in it, than the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that this was acknowledged by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Were all that took the Covenant bound thereby to endeavour to introduce the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56448:81"/>becauſe they obliged themſelves to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend Religion in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to reform Religion in the Church of <hi>England! Vid. Contin. p.</hi> 168.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. They engaged only in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings, and ſo far as lawfully they might to preſerve Religion in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Common Enemy, notwithſtanding which the <hi>Scots</hi> might reform ought that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs or defective, with his Majeſties leave and conſent, in a legal manner. And the <hi>Engliſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters</hi> were not bound to model the Church-Government in <hi>England</hi> according to the pattern of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but according to the Word of God and the beſt Reformed Churches. Whether <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. was the beſt Reformed Church, was not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And the Engliſh were not engaged in their places and callings, and ſo far as lawfully they might, by the Covenant, to follow the Model of any one of theſe, or all the Reformed Churches, in any thing diſagreeing from the Word of God; and in caſe a primitive Epiſcopacy (that is, Church-Government by a Biſhop, with a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery as his Counſellors and Aſſiſtants) prove moſt agreeable to the Word of God, they were bound to ſet up, (onely in their places and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſo far as lawfully they might) that Government in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> when Lord
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56448:81"/>
               <hi>Digby,</hi> hath written in his Letters to Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> viz. <hi>He that would reduce the Church now, to the Form of Government in the most primitive times, ſhould not take, in my Opinion, the beſt nor the wiſeſt courſe, I am ſure not the ſafeſt; for he would be found pecking towards the Presbytery of</hi> Scotland, <hi>which for my part I believe, in point of Government, hath a greater reſemblance than yours or ours, to the firſt Age of Chriſts Church.</hi> But whatever was the meaning of the Impoſers or Takers of the Covenant in thoſe days, I have heard an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſon, a Doctor that had taken it, though a Nonconformiſt, declare, That he was not bound by it to endeavour any other Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than what he had been obliged unto, if he never had taken the Covenant; that he is not bound to uſe any unlawful or ſeditious means, or endeavours, to bring about a Reformation. That the Law of the Land is the Rule to judge by, what means or endeavours are unlawful and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Do not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> play faſt and looſe, and turn with the wind? Was not the time once when they held Ruling Elders to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but now they hold no ſuch matter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I believe the Scottiſh <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were and ſtill are of that Judgement, that <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders</hi> are <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> but I knew few Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, if any, that held that Office ſo, ſave onely in a large ſence; as many <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> now hold
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56448:82"/>Biſhops to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that is, a lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, not repugnant to the Word of God. However, 'tis ſaid, and that by no mean Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>That Geneva did not firſt inſtitute thoſe Officers, but only reſtored them.</hi> And I have read that it was acknowledged by a great Prelate, <hi>That the Church had in every Church certain Seniors, to whom the Government of the Church was committed.</hi> Surely they are as tolerable in a Church, where the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power thinks good to eſtabliſh that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as are Chancellors, Commiſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in caſe that ſome <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of old, held them of uſe in the Apoſtles days, this alone (without an Inſtitution and an Injunction to perpetuate them) doth not make them, or any other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Officers, unalterable; for we ſee that the Office of Widdows is laid aſide in the Church, notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Did not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> wholly lay aſide the uſe of the Lords Supper? And was it not for want of Ruling Elders?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They celebrated the Lords Supper in <hi>London,</hi> and that too in ſome Churches, once a Month; and frequently at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in many other places: Poſſibly the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſettlement might hinder the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of that Ordinance for a time in many places. Bur I knew a Pariſh where it was a long time diſuſed, though deſired, becauſe the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoners did not provide (though oft urged unto
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56448:82"/>it by the Miniſter) decent and neceſſary Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils for the Celebration of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Do the Nonconformiſts decry all uſe of Reaſon in Theology?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They uſe frequently Reaſons in their Sermons. Indeed they allow Reaſon but the ſecond place in Divinity; to Revelation they give the firſt. Reaſon and Philoſophy they make to be the Handmaids, but Divinity they honour as their Soveraign Lady and Queen. Reaſon is the Counſellor, but Revelation is the Law-giver. We ſay the Light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is as the Light of a Glow-Worm, or of a Candle, or (if you will needs have it) as the Light of the Moon; but the Light of Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> is as the Light of the Sun, when it ſhineth in its full ſtrength.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>T.</hi>
               </note> And with a reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor, we allow the uſe of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, although we would have it ſnuffed; and when it is ſet up in the houſe, we would not have the Window ſhut, either to keep our, or at leaſt to darken the Light of the Sun. We prefer fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Manna, before feeding on Acorns and Husks; the Commands of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before the Precepts of <hi>Plato;</hi> the Maſs of Gold in the Mine, before a few pieces of Silver ſcattered here and there in the Studies of Philoſophers.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Donatists,</hi> as they had no cauſe in regard of the Faith (by reaſon of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Doctrines or Practices impoſed on them) to ceaſe from communicating with any part of the Catholick Church; ſo they divided from the whole Church, with the breach of Charity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning it for no Church, and drawing the Communion wholly to themſelves. The <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> do not condemn the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as no Church; they do not confine the Communion to themſelves; they humbly pray a Reformation of ſome things which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive amiſs, and are willing to have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them as Parts of the Catholick Church (ſaving the Practices wherein they differ) they leave them to their Liberty, and deſire a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for themſelves to ſerve God according to their Conſciences. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſhewed their Charity in their earneſt endeavours to ſave the life of Dr. <hi>Hewit</hi> an Epiſcopal Dr; for which purpoſe, they joyned in an Addreſs to <hi>O. C.</hi> the only Addreſs they ever made unto him; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor <hi>Congregationiſts,</hi> charge the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> for being Schiſmaticks, becauſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56448:84"/>they do not communicate with their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet they look upon themſelves as true Churches of Chriſt, and both for Doctrine and Diſcipline, to come as near the Scripture-Patern as themſelves. They offered to Unite and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with the <hi>Epiſcopal-Clergy</hi> upon Chriſtian terms, before His Majeſties Return, and ſince. As for out Brethren of <hi>New England,</hi> they are of Age, let them anſwer for themſelves. As for our <hi>Congreational Brethren</hi> at home, I lately heard that Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſhould profeſs to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion even with the <hi>Lutheran Churches.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> profeſſeth againſt all <hi>Impoſitions;</hi> and that 'tis his Judgment, That the <hi>Epiſcopals</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> be left to worſhip God as they judge in their Conſciences beſt; That for his part, he judgeth no man for his Conformity, provided he be not a Perſecuter of thoſe that cannot.</p>
            <p>Finally, The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire much rather a Reformation, or well ſtated Comprehenſion, than a Toleration; and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Schiſm and Separation, truly ſo called, as much as any; which they have ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by their conſtantly declared Opinions and Practice: They would be glad to ſee the day, when being eaſed of burdenſome Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they might have opportunity to manifeſt this their ſincere deſire of Union and Coalition with the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>YOu have dealt with us, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did with our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour;</hi> blindfolded us, &amp; ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us, &amp; in effect bid us Propheſie <hi>who it is that ſmote us.</hi> Some gheſſes have been who you are by the roughneſs of your hand, and the ſmartneſs of the blow; I have not taken upon me thus to ſhoot in the dark, and yet pretend to hit the Mark. Nor will I go about to pull off the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor you put upon your own face, but to wipe off the dirt which you have caſt on ours. To this purpoſe I pray you, after theſe premiſed Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by me on ſome Paſſages in your <hi>Friendly Debate, &amp;c.</hi> you would be pleaſed to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelf, and to ask your ſelf theſe few <hi>Queſtions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether or no you might not with as much reaſon, and more charity, have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Teſtimonies out of the <hi>Large Annotations,</hi> Printed in the year 1651. to clear <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> from temporizing, and conniving at Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as you have done the Omiſſions you charge them withal in the <hi>Edition</hi> of 1646, to prove
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56448:85"/>them guilty. And ſure I am, if you had pleaſed to ſearch, you might have found in the <hi>Last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> their diſlike of Sacriledge in their <hi>Notes</hi> on <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. <hi>It is a ſnare to the man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth that which is holy.</hi> That is, ſay the <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> to apply it, or take it to his own uſe, which was appointed to Gods: yea, to go about to do it by inquiring how the <hi>Vow</hi> might be made void. As alſo on <hi>Acts</hi> 5.1. in the caſe of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> they declare plainly and fully againſt Sacriledge as followeth. The ſcope of this Hiſtory is to ſhew how odious to God that perfidiouſneſs is, which counterfeiting Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would impoſe upon God, as if He ſaw not what men do; for otherwiſe (<hi>Ananias</hi> giving a <hi>part,</hi> had been commendable) ſo great a miſchief is Hypocriſie, ſo dangerous the perverſion of an Holy purpoſe, and the with-drawing of things Conſecrated to the Churches uſe (though by himſelf who gave) that the Sacriligious periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by detaining a <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>whole</hi> which he would ſeem to give. — If he that taketh from the Church but a little of that which was his own, be Sacriligious &amp; ſtruck dead for the ſame, what puniſhment will the ſame Divine Juſtice lay on him, who by fraud or violence taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Poſſeſſions wherewith other men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the Church?</p>
            <p>And upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. to that Queſtion which ſome make, why the Apoſtle doth vary the crime,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56448:85"/>ſaying, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, dost thou commit Sacrilege, and not rather dost thou commit Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</hi> They give this Anſwer for one, That the Apoſtle uſeth an aggravation, as if he ſhould ſay, Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit a worſe ſin, to wit, Sacrilege?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Whether Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Sermon (<hi>pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9.) Preached at <hi>Warring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton May</hi> 11.) and Printed at <hi>London</hi> with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur, <hi>June</hi> 9. 1669. charging all <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> who pray before and after Sermon, any Prayers beſides thoſe of the Publick Liturgy, as guilty of ſacrilegiouſly breaking their Vows and Promiſes, may not as juſtly be urged againſt <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> his Complaint againſt <hi>Covenant-breaking,</hi> be urged againſt <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> to prove them tranſgreſſors of the 3d <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> in the main ſence and meaning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether it may not as reaſonably be deſired, that the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> ſhould be agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Rule and Standard of Conformity,</hi> before <hi>others</hi> be preſſed to come <hi>up to it;</hi> as to require that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ſhould be all agreed what will ſatisfie them before any condeſcentions may be deſired for, or granted to them. Are the <hi>Old Canons</hi> Law, or are they not? Are the <hi>Canons</hi> made in the <hi>Synod</hi> 1640, Law or not? Muſt we read <hi>Second Service</hi> at the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> or muſt we not? Muſt we pray <hi>before Sermon,</hi> or muſt we only bid or exhort the People to Pray?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whether they are not to be reputed <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,</hi> who go <hi>beyond the law,</hi> &amp; do more then is required? who uſe other Rites &amp; Ceremonies, then the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> injoyns, as well as thoſe that <hi>fall ſhort</hi> of <hi>doing ſome things</hi> by law required?</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Whether it may not well become our Spiritual Fathers and Brethren of the Church, to yield a little in things indifferent to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe (ſuppoſe they be in an error) who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſcruple the lawfulneſs of them, and who are ready to take a ſolemn Oath that they would <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> if they could but be once convinced, that by their Obedience to mans Ordinances, they ſhould not diſobey the Laws of God.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 9. Why you are pleaſed to charge the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts</hi> with ſo much rigor &amp; ſeverity againſt Diſſenters formerly, without remembring that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi> were Publick Preachers in the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> in thoſe times; or that the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> enjoyed a good Parſonage; and that the greateſt part of the now <hi>Conformiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> had publick Imployment in thoſe times?</p>

Whether if His Majeſty and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, would be graciouſly pleaſed to leave the uſe of the Three Ceremonies of our Church as indifferent, as the Canons in 1640 do the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Bowing towards the East, or Altar;</hi> That Rule of Charity might not be ſtill obſerved, namely, That thoſe which uſe theſe Ceremonies ſhould not deſpiſe them that uſe them not; and that thoſe who uſe them not, condemn not thoſe that uſe them?</p>

I ſay not, <hi>What I have written, I have written;</hi> but rather, if I have written any thing which ſhall he truly interpreted Seditious or Schiſmatical, or which is juſtly offenſive to any of my Superiors, Inferiors, or Equals in Church or State, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg Pardon, and Conclude; deſiring you and all my Brethren, <hi>Conformists</hi> and <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> to joyn in that good Prayer, <hi>Give Peace in our time, O Lord.</hi>
